# This examples taskrun exercises the behaviour of the pullrequest
# resource when the output pullrequest resource matches exactly the
# input pullrequest resource.
#
# A step is used to copy the input resource's data directly to the
# output resource's workspace directory. The output resource should
# then read the copied data and skip sending any changes to GitHub.
#
# Importantly the output pullrequest should _not_ fail to read the
# data from its workspace directory, regardless of which user the
# copy step ran as and the ownership permissions attached to the
# pr.json file.
#
# `PipelineResources` are deprecated, consider using `Tasks` and other replacement features instead
