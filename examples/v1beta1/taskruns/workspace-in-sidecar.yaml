# This example TaskRun demonstrates how to share a Workspace between Steps
# and a Sidecar. The Sidecar must be explicitly configured to mount the
# volume backing a Workspace so that it has access to it.
#
# The Step writes a file to the Workspace and then waits for the Sidecar
# to respond. The Sidecar sees the Step's file and writes its response.
# The Step sees the response and exits.
