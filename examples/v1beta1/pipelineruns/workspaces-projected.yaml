# In this contrived example two different kinds of workspace volume are used to thread
# data through a pipeline's tasks.
# 1. A projected volume combines a:
#   - ConfigMap as source of recipe data.
#   - Secret to store a password.
# 2. A PVC is used to share data from one task to the next.
#
# The end result is a pipeline that first checks if the password is correct and, if so,
# copies data out of a recipe store onto a shared volume. The recipe data is then read
# by a subsequent task and printed to screen.
