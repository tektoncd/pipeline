        description: PipelineRun represents a single execution of a Pipeline. PipelineRuns are how the graph of Tasks declared in a Pipeline are executed; they specify inputs to Pipelines such as parameter values and capture operational aspects of the Tasks execution such as service account and tolerations. Creating a PipelineRun creates TaskRuns for Tasks in the referenced Pipeline.

When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

                                  description: 'PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler. The Pod''s termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod''s termination grace period. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached.

Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container''s environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod''s lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. This is an alpha feature enabled by the StartupProbe feature flag. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes'
