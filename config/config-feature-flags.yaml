  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton to create an
  # Affinity Assistant for every TaskRun sharing a PVC workspace
  #
  # The default behaviour is for Tekton to create Affinity Assistants
  #
  # See more in the workspace documentation about Affinity Assistant
  # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/workspaces.md#affinity-assistant-and-specifying-workspace-order-in-a-pipeline
  # or https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/2630 for more info.
  disable-affinity-assistant: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "false" will allow Tekton to override your
  # Task container's $HOME environment variable.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2013 for more
  # info.
  disable-home-env-overwrite: "true"
  # Setting this flag to "false" will allow Tekton to override your
  # Task container's working directory.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1836 for more
  # info.
  disable-working-directory-overwrite: "true"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will prevent Tekton scanning attached
  # service accounts and injecting any credentials it finds into your
  # Steps.
  #
  # The default behaviour currently is for Tekton to search service
  # accounts for secrets matching a specified format and automatically
  # mount those into your Steps.
  #
  # Note: setting this to "true" will prevent PipelineResources from
  # working.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2791 for more
  # info.
  disable-creds-init: "false"
  # This option should be set to false when Pipelines is running in a
  # cluster that does not use injected sidecars such as Istio. Setting
  # it to false should decrease the time it takes for a TaskRun to start
  # running. For clusters that use injected sidecars, setting this
  # option to false can lead to unexpected behavior.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2080 for more info.
  running-in-environment-with-injected-sidecars: "true"
  # Setting this flag to "true" will require that any Git SSH Secret
  # offered to Tekton must have known_hosts included.
  #
  # See https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/2981 for more
  # info.
  require-git-ssh-secret-known-hosts: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "true" enables the use of Tekton OCI bundle.
  # This is an experimental feature and thus should still be considered
  # an alpha feature.
  enable-tekton-oci-bundles: "false"
  # Setting this flag to "true" enables the use of custom tasks from
  # within pipelines.
  # This is an experimental feature and thus should still be considered
  # an alpha feature.
  enable-custom-tasks: "false"
  # Setting this flag will determine which gated features are enabled.
  # Acceptable values are "stable" or "alpha".
  enable-api-fields: "stable"
  # Setting this flag to "true" scopes when expressions to guard a Task only
  # instead of a Task and its dependent Tasks.
