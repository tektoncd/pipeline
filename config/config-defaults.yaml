    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # default-timeout-minutes contains the default number of
    # minutes to use for TaskRun and PipelineRun, if none is specified.
    default-timeout-minutes: "60"  # 60 minutes

    # default-service-account contains the default service account name
    # to use for TaskRun and PipelineRun, if none is specified.
    default-service-account: "default"

    # default-managed-by-label-value contains the default value given to the
    # "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" label applied to all Pods created for
    # TaskRuns. If a user's requested TaskRun specifies another value for this
    # label, the user's request supercedes.
    default-managed-by-label-value: "tekton-pipelines"

    # default-pod-template contains the default pod template to use for
    # TaskRun and PipelineRun. If a pod template is specified on the
    # PipelineRun, the default-pod-template is merged with that one.
    # default-pod-template:

    # default-affinity-assistant-pod-template contains the default pod template
    # to use for affinity assistant pods. If a pod template is specified on the
    # PipelineRun, the default-affinity-assistant-pod-template is merged with
    # that one.
    # default-affinity-assistant-pod-template:

    # default-cloud-events-sink contains the default CloudEvents sink to be
    # used for TaskRun and PipelineRun, when no sink is specified.
    # Note that right now it is still not possible to set a PipelineRun or
    # TaskRun specific sink, so the default is the only option available.
    # If no sink is specified, no CloudEvent is generated
    # default-cloud-events-sink:

    # default-task-run-workspace-binding contains the default workspace
    # configuration provided for any Workspaces that a Task declares
    # but that a TaskRun does not explicitly provide.
