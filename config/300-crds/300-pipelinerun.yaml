                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                skew.
                              A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                              labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |

                              If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                              to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                              MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                              won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                    be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                    This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                    between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                    In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                    - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                    violate MaxSkew(1).
                                    - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                    to topologies that satisfy it.
                                    It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                    MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                    When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                      skew.
                                    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                    "MaxSkew" on some topology.

                                    If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                    to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                    MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

            PipelineRun represents a single execution of a Pipeline. PipelineRuns are how
            the graph of Tasks declared in a Pipeline are executed; they specify inputs
            to Pipelines such as parameter values and capture operational aspects of the
            Tasks execution such as service account and tolerations. Creating a
            PipelineRun creates TaskRuns for Tasks in the referenced Pipeline.

                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same

                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                    and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                    We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                    of pods into each bucket.
                                    We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                    Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                    nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                    e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                    WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                    the spread constraint.
                                    - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                    - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                      skew.
                                    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                    if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                    "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                    If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                    to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                    MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                    won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                  MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                  spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                  to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                  for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                  MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                  Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                  be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                  This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
