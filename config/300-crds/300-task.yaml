            Task represents a collection of sequential steps that are run as part of a
            Pipeline using a set of inputs and producing a set of outputs. Tasks execute
            when TaskRuns are created that provide the input parameters and resources and
            output resources the Task requires.

            Deprecated: Please use v1.Task instead.

                          when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is

                          description: |-
                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                            API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                          DeprecatedStartupProbe indicates that the Pod this Step runs in has successfully initialized.
                          If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
                          If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
                          This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
                          when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.
                          This cannot be updated.

                              preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                              container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                              recursively.

                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
