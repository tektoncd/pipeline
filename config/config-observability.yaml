    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # metrics.backend-destination field specifies the system metrics destination.
    # It supports either prometheus (the default) or stackdriver.
    # Note: Using Stackdriver will incur additional charges.

    # metrics.stackdriver-project-id field specifies the Stackdriver project ID. This
    # field is optional. When running on GCE, application default credentials will be
    # used and metrics will be sent to the cluster's project if this field is
    # not provided.

    # metrics.allow-stackdriver-custom-metrics indicates whether it is allowed
    # to send metrics to Stackdriver using "global" resource type and custom
    # metric type. Setting this flag to "true" could cause extra Stackdriver
    # charge.  If metrics.backend-destination is not Stackdriver, this is
