    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.
    # lease-duration is how long non-leaders will wait to try to acquire the
    # lock; 15 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    lease-duration: "60s"
    # renew-deadline is how long a leader will try to renew the lease before
    # giving up; 10 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    renew-deadline: "40s"
    # retry-period is how long the leader election client waits between tries of
    # actions; 2 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    retry-period: "10s"
    # buckets is the number of buckets used to partition key space of each
    # Reconciler. If this number is M and the replica number of the controller
    # is N, the N replicas will compete for the M buckets. The owner of a
    # bucket will take care of the reconciling for the keys partitioned into
    # that bucket.
    buckets: "1"
