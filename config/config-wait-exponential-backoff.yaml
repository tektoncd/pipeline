# This ConfigMap allows cluster operators to configure the exponential backoff
# parameters used by Tekton Pipelines when retrying Kubernetes API operations,
# such as creating TaskRuns or CustomRuns. Adjusting these values can help
# tune retry behavior in response to webhook timeouts or transient errors.
