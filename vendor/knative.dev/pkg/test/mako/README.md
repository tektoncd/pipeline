# Mako

[Mako](https://github.com/google/mako) is an open source project for performance
testing in Knative. It offers capacities like data storage, charting,
statistical aggregation and automated regression analysis.

This folder contains common code that can be used by all Knative projects, with
which we can follow the same process to set up Mako and collaborate.
