## Overview

A `Task` is a collection of `Steps` that you
define and arrange in a specific order of execution as part of your continuous integration flow.
A `Task` executes as a Pod on your Kubernetes cluster. A `Task` is available within a specific
namespace, while a `ClusterTask` is available across the entire cluster.

A `Task` declaration includes the following elements:

- [Parameters](#specifying-parameters)
- [Resources](#specifying-resources)
- [Steps](#defining-steps)
- [Workspaces](#specifying-workspaces)
- [Results](#emitting-results)

## Configuring a `Task`

A `Task` definition supports the following fields:

- Required:
  - [`apiVersion`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the API version. For example,
    `tekton.dev/v1beta1`.
  - [`kind`][kubernetes-overview] - Identifies this resource object as a `Task` object.
  - [`metadata`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies metadata that uniquely identifies the
    `Task` resource object. For example, a `name`.
  - [`spec`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the configuration information for
    this `Task` resource object.
  - [`steps`](#defining-steps) - Specifies one or more container images to run in the `Task`.
- Optional:
  - [`description`](#adding-a-description) - An informative description of the `Task`.
  - [`params`](#specifying-parameters) - Specifies execution parameters for the `Task`.
  - [`resources`](#specifying-resources) - **alpha only** Specifies
    [`PipelineResources`](resources.md) needed or created by your`Task`.
    - [`inputs`](#specifying-resources) - Specifies the resources ingested by the `Task`.
    - [`outputs`](#specifying-resources) - Specifies the resources produced by the `Task`.
  - [`workspaces`](#specifying-workspaces) - Specifies paths to volumes required by the `Task`.
  - [`results`](#emitting-results) - Specifies the names under which `Tasks` write execution results.
  - [`volumes`](#specifying-volumes) - Specifies one or more volumes that will be available to the `Steps` in the `Task`.
  - [`stepTemplate`](#specifying-a-step-template) - Specifies a `Container` step definition to use as the basis for all `Steps` in the `Task`.
  - [`sidecars`](#specifying-sidecars) - Specifies `Sidecar` containers to run alongside the `Steps` in the `Task`.

[kubernetes-overview]:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields

The non-functional example below demonstrates the use of most of the above-mentioned fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: example-task-name
spec:
  params:
    - name: pathToDockerFile
      type: string
      description: The path to the dockerfile to build
      default: /workspace/workspace/Dockerfile
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: workspace
        type: git
    outputs:
      - name: builtImage
        type: image
  steps:
    - name: ubuntu-example
      image: ubuntu
      args: ["ubuntu-build-example", "SECRETS-example.md"]
    - image: gcr.io/example-builders/build-example
      command: ["echo"]
      args: ["$(params.pathToDockerFile)"]
    - name: dockerfile-pushexample
      image: gcr.io/example-builders/push-example
      args: ["push", "$(resources.outputs.builtImage.url)"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: docker-socket-example
          mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
  volumes:
    - name: example-volume
      emptyDir: {}
```

### `Task` vs. `ClusterTask`

A `ClusterTask` is a `Task` scoped to the entire cluster instead of a single namespace.
A `ClusterTask` behaves identically to a `Task` and therefore everything in this document
applies to both.

**Note:** When using a `ClusterTask`, you must explicitly set the `kind` sub-field in the `taskRef` field to `ClusterTask`.
          If not specified, the `kind` sub-field defaults to `Task.`

Below is an example of a Pipeline declaration that uses a `ClusterTask`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: demo-pipeline
  namespace: default
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: build-skaffold-web
      taskRef:
        name: build-push
        kind: ClusterTask
      params: ....
```

### Defining `Steps`

A `Step` is a reference to a container image that executes a specific tool on a
specific input and produces a specific output. To add `Steps` to a `Task` you
define a `steps` field (required) containing a list of desired `Steps`. The order in
which the `Steps` appear in this list is the order in which they will execute.

The following requirements apply to each container image referenced in a `steps` field:

- The container image must abide by the [container contract](./container-contract.md).
- Each container image runs to completion or until the first failure occurs.
- The CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage resource requests will be set
  to zero (also known as
  [BestEffort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-besteffort)),
  or, if specified, the minimums set through `LimitRanges` in that
  `Namespace`, if the container image does not have the largest
  resource request out of all container images in the `Task.` This
  ensures that the Pod that executes the `Task` only requests enough
  resources to run a single container image in the `Task` rather than
  hoard resources for all container images in the `Task` at once.

Below is an example of setting the resource requests and limits for a step:

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
    - name: step-with-limts
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 1Gi
          cpu: 500m
        limits:
          memory: 2Gi
          cpu: 800m
```

#### Reserved directories

There are several directories that all `Tasks` run by Tekton will treat as special

* `/workspace` - This directory is where [resources](#specifying-resources) and [workspaces](#specifying-workspaces)
  are mounted. Paths to these are available to `Task` authors via [variable substitution](variables.md)
* `/tekton` - This directory is used for Tekton specific functionality:
    * `/tekton/results` is where [results](#emitting-results) are written to.
      The path is available to `Task` authors via [`$(results.name.path)`](variables.md)
    * There are other subfolders which are [implementation details of Tekton](developers/README.md#reserved-directories)
      and **users should not rely on their specific behavior as it may change in the future**

#### Running scripts within `Steps`

A step can specify a `script` field, which contains the body of a script. That script is
invoked as if it were stored inside the container image, and any `args` are passed directly
to it.

**Note:** If the `script` field is present, the step cannot also contain a `command` field.

Scripts that do not start with a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))
line will have the following default preamble prepended:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -xe
```

You can override this default preamble by prepending a shebang that specifies the desired parser.
This parser must be present within that `Step's` container image.

The example below executes a Bash script:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: ubuntu # contains bash
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      echo "Hello from Bash!"
```

The example below executes a Python script:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: python # contains python
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env python3
      print("Hello from Python!")
```

The example below executes a Node script:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: node # contains node
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env node
      console.log("Hello from Node!")
```

You can execute scripts directly in the workspace:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: ubuntu
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      /workspace/my-script.sh  # provided by an input resource
```

You can also execute scripts within the container image:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: my-image # contains /bin/my-binary
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      /bin/my-binary
```

##### Windows scripts

Scripts in tasks that will eventually run on windows nodes need a custom shebang line, so that Tekton knows how to run the script. The format of the shebang line is:

`#!win <interpreter command> <args>`

Unlike linux, we need to specify how to interpret the script file which is generated by Tekton. The example below shows how to execute a powershell script:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809
    script: |
      #!win powershell.exe -File
      echo 'Hello from PowerShell'
```

Microsoft provide `powershell` images, which contain Powershell Core (which is slightly different from powershell found in standard windows images). The example below shows how to use these images:
```yaml
steps:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:nanoserver
    script: |
      #!win pwsh.exe -File
      echo 'Hello from PowerShell Core'
```

As can be seen the command is different. The windows shebang can be used for any interpreter, as long as it exists in the image and can interpret commands from a file. The example below executes a Python script:
```yaml
  steps:
  - image: python
    script: |
      #!win python
      print("Hello from Python!")
```
Note that other than the `#!win` shebang the example is identical to the earlier linux example.

Finally, if no interpreter is specified on the `#!win` line then the script will be treated as a windows `.cmd` file which will be excecuted. The example below shows this:
```yaml
  steps:
  - image: mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:lts-nanoserver-1809
    script: |
      #!win
      echo Hello from the default cmd file
```

#### Specifying a timeout

A `Step` can specify a `timeout` field.
If the `Step` execution time exceeds the specified timeout, the `Step` kills
its running process and any subsequent `Steps` in the `TaskRun` will not be
executed. The `TaskRun` is placed into a `Failed` condition.  An accompanying log
describing which `Step` timed out is written as the `Failed` condition's message.

The timeout specification follows the duration format as specified in the [Go time package](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) (e.g. 1s or 1ms).

The example `Step` below is supposed to sleep for 60 seconds but will be canceled by the specified 5 second timeout.
```yaml
steps:
  - name: sleep-then-timeout
    image: ubuntu
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      echo "I am supposed to sleep for 60 seconds!"
      sleep 60
    timeout: 5s
``` 

#### Specifying `onError` for a `step`

When a `step` in a `task` results in a failure, the rest of the steps in the `task` are skipped and the `taskRun` is
declared a failure. If you would like to ignore such step errors and continue executing the rest of the steps in
the task, you can specify `onError` for such a `step`.

`onError` can be set to either `continue` or `stopAndFail` as part of the step definition. If `onError` is
set to `continue`, the entrypoint sets the original failed exit code of the [script](#running-scripts-within-steps)
in the container terminated state. A `step` with `onError` set to `continue` does not fail the `taskRun` and continues
executing the rest of the steps in a task.

To ignore a step error, set `onError` to `continue`:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: docker.io/library/golang:latest
    name: ignore-unit-test-failure
    onError: continue
    script: |
      go test .
```

The original failed exit code of the [script](#running-scripts-within-steps) is available in the terminated state of
the container.

```
kubectl get tr taskrun-unit-test-t6qcl -o json | jq .status
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "message": "All Steps have completed executing",
      "reason": "Succeeded",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "Succeeded"
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "container": "step-ignore-unit-test-failure",
      "imageID": "...",
      "name": "ignore-unit-test-failure",
      "terminated": {
        "containerID": "...",
        "exitCode": 1,
        "reason": "Completed",
      }
    },
  ],
```

For an end-to-end example, see [the taskRun ignoring a step error](../examples/v1beta1/taskruns/ignore-step-error.yaml)
and [the pipelineRun ignoring a step error](../examples/v1beta1/pipelineruns/ignore-step-error.yaml).

#### Accessing Step's `exitCode` in subsequent `Steps`

A step can access the exit code of any previous step by reading the file pointed to by the `exitCode` path variable:

```shell
cat $(steps.step-<step-name>.exitCode.path)
```

The `exitCode` of a step without any name can be referenced using:

```shell
cat $(steps.step-unnamed-<step-index>.exitCode.path)
```

#### Produce a task result with `onError`

When a step is set to ignore the step error and if that step is able to initialize a result file before failing,
that result is made available to its consumer task.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: ignore-failure-and-produce-a-result
    onError: continue
    image: busybox
    script: |
      echo -n 123 | tee $(results.result1.path)
      exit 1
```

The task consuming the result using the result reference `$(tasks.task1.results.result1)` in a `pipeline` will be able
to access the result and run with the resolved value.

Now, a step can fail before initializing a result and the `pipeline` can ignore such step failure. But, the  `pipeline`
will fail with `InvalidTaskResultReference` if it has a task consuming that task result. For example, any task
consuming `$(tasks.task1.results.result2)` will cause the pipeline to fail.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: ignore-failure-and-produce-a-result
    onError: continue
    image: busybox
    script: |
      echo -n 123 | tee $(results.result1.path)
      exit 1
      echo -n 456 | tee $(results.result2.path)
```

#### Breakpoint on failure with `onError`

[Debugging](taskruns.md#debugging-a-taskrun) a taskRun is supported to debug a container and comes with a set of
[tools](taskruns.md#debug-environment) to declare the step as a failure or a success. Specifying
[breakpoint](taskruns.md#breakpoint-on-failure) at the `taskRun` level overrides ignoring a step error using `onError`.

### Specifying `Parameters`

You can specify parameters, such as compilation flags or artifact names, that you want to supply to the `Task` at execution time.
 `Parameters` are passed to the `Task` from its corresponding `TaskRun`.

Parameter names:

- Must only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), and dots (`.`).
- Must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`).

For example, `foo.Is-Bar_` is a valid parameter name, but `barIsBa$` or `0banana` are not.

Each declared parameter has a `type` field, which can be set to either `array` or `string`. `array` is useful in cases where the number
of compilation flags being supplied to a task varies throughout the `Task's` execution. If not specified, the `type` field defaults to
`string`. When the actual parameter value is supplied, its parsed type is validated against the `type` field.

The following example illustrates the use of `Parameters` in a `Task`. The `Task` declares two input parameters named `flags`
(of type `array`) and `someURL` (of type `string`), and uses them in the `steps.args` list. You can expand parameters of type `array`
inside an existing array using the star operator. In this example, `flags` contains the star operator: `$(params.flags[*])`.

**Note:** Input parameter values can be used as variables throughout the `Task` by using [variable substitution](#using-variable-substitution).

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: task-with-parameters
spec:
  params:
    - name: flags
      type: array
    - name: someURL
      type: string
  steps:
    - name: build
      image: my-builder
      args: [
        "build",
        "$(params.flags[*])",
        # It would be equivalent to use $(params["someURL"]) here,
        # which is necessary when the parameter name contains '.'
        # characters (e.g. `$(params["some.other.URL"])`)
        'url=$(params.someURL)',
      ]
```

The following `TaskRun` supplies a dynamic number of strings within the `flags` parameter:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: run-with-parameters
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: task-with-parameters
  params:
    - name: flags
      value:
        - "--set"
        - "arg1=foo"
        - "--randomflag"
        - "--someotherflag"
    - name: someURL
      value: "http://google.com"
```

### Specifying `Resources`

A `Task` definition can specify input and output resources supplied by
a [`PipelineResources`](resources.md#using-resources) entity.

Use the `input` field to supply your `Task` with the context and/or data it needs to execute.
If the output of your `Task` is also the input of the next `Task` that executes, you must
make that data available to that `Task` at `/workspace/output/resource_name/`. For example:

```yaml
resources:
  outputs:
    name: storage-gcs
    type: gcs
steps:
  - image: objectuser/run-java-jar #https://hub.docker.com/r/objectuser/run-java-jar/
    command: [jar]
    args: ["-cvf", "-o", "/workspace/output/storage-gcs/", "projectname.war", "*"]
    env:
      - name: "FOO"
        value: "world"
```

**Note**: If the `Task` relies on output resource functionality then the
containers in the `Task's` `steps` field cannot mount anything in the path
`/workspace/output`.

In the following example, the `tar-artifact` resource is used as both input and
output. Thus, the input resource is copied into the `customworkspace` directory,
as specified in the `targetPath` field. The `untar` `Step` extracts the tarball
into the `tar-scratch-space` directory. The `edit-tar` `Step` adds a new file,
and the `tar-it-up` `Step` creates a new tarball and places it in the
`/workspace/customworkspace/` directory. When the `Task` completes execution,
it places the resulting tarball in the `/workspace/customworkspace` directory
and uploads it to the bucket defined in the `tar-artifact` field.

```yaml
resources:
  inputs:
    name: tar-artifact
    targetPath: customworkspace
  outputs:
    name: tar-artifact
steps:
  - name: untar
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "mkdir -p /workspace/tar-scratch-space/ && tar -xvf /workspace/customworkspace/rules_docker-master.tar -C /workspace/tar-scratch-space/"]
  - name: edit-tar
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "echo crazy > /workspace/tar-scratch-space/rules_docker-master/crazy.txt"]
  - name: tar-it-up
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "cd /workspace/tar-scratch-space/ && tar -cvf /workspace/customworkspace/rules_docker-master.tar rules_docker-master"]
```

### Specifying `Workspaces`

[`Workspaces`](workspaces.md#using-workspaces-in-tasks) allow you to specify
one or more volumes that your `Task` requires during execution. It is recommended that `Tasks` uses **at most**
one writeable `Workspace`. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
    - name: write-message
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        set -xe
        echo hello! > $(workspaces.messages.path)/message
  workspaces:
    - name: messages
      description: The folder where we write the message to
      mountPath: /custom/path/relative/to/root
```

For more information, see [Using `Workspaces` in `Tasks`](workspaces.md#using-workspaces-in-tasks)
and the [`Workspaces` in a `TaskRun`](../examples/v1beta1/taskruns/workspace.yaml) example YAML file.

### Emitting `Results`

A Task is able to emit string results that can be viewed by users and passed to other Tasks in a Pipeline. These
results have a wide variety of potential uses. To highlight just a few examples from the Tekton Catalog: the
[`git-clone` Task](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/main/task/git-clone/0.1/git-clone.yaml) emits a
cloned commit SHA as a result, the [`generate-build-id` Task](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/main/task/generate-build-id/0.1/generate-build-id.yaml)
emits a randomized ID as a result, and the [`kaniko` Task](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/kaniko/0.1)
emits a container image digest as a result. In each case these results convey information for users to see when
looking at their TaskRuns and can also be used in a Pipeline to pass data along from one Task to the next.

To define a `Task's` results, use the `results` field. Each `results` entry in the `Task's` YAML corresponds to a
file that the `Task` should stores the result in. These files should be created by a `Task` in the
`/tekton/results` directory. The directory itself is created automatically if the `Task` has
a `results` field but it's the responsibility of the `Task` to generate its contents.

It's important to note that Tekton does not perform any processing on the contents of results; they are emitted
verbatim from your Task including any leading or trailing whitespace characters. Make sure to write only the
precise string you want returned from your `Task` into the `/tekton/results/` files that your `Task` creates.
You can use [`$(results.name.path)`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/variables.md#variables-available-in-a-task)
to avoid having to hardcode this path.

In the example below, the `Task` specifies two files in the `results` field:
`current-date-unix-timestamp` and `current-date-human-readable`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: print-date
  annotations:
    description: |
      A simple task that prints the date
spec:
  results:
    - name: current-date-unix-timestamp
      description: The current date in unix timestamp format
    - name: current-date-human-readable
      description: The current date in human readable format
  steps:
    - name: print-date-unix-timestamp
      image: bash:latest
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        date +%s | tee $(results.current-date-unix-timestamp.path)
    - name: print-date-human-readable
      image: bash:latest
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        date | tee $(results.current-date-human-readable.path)
```

The stored results can be used [at the `Task` level](./pipelines.md#configuring-execution-results-at-the-task-level)
or [at the `Pipeline` level](./pipelines.md#configuring-execution-results-at-the-pipeline-level).

**Note:** The maximum size of a `Task's` results is limited by the container termination message feature of Kubernetes,
as results are passed back to the controller via this mechanism. At present, the limit is
["4096 bytes"](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/96e13de777a9eb57f87889072b68ac40467209ac/pkg/kubelet/container/runtime.go#L632).
Results are written to the termination message encoded as JSON objects and Tekton uses those objects
to pass additional information to the controller. As such, `Task` results are best suited for holding
small amounts of data, such as commit SHAs, branch names, ephemeral namespaces, and so on.

If your `Task` writes a large number of small results, you can work around this limitation
by writing each result from a separate `Step` so that each `Step` has its own termination message.
If a termination message is detected as being too large the TaskRun will be placed into a failed state
with the following message: `Termination message is above max allowed size 4096, caused by large task
result`. Since Tekton also uses the termination message for some internal information, so the real
available size will less than 4096 bytes.

As a general rule-of-thumb, if a result needs to be larger than a kilobyte, you should likely use a
[`Workspace`](#specifying-workspaces) to store and pass it between `Tasks` within a `Pipeline`.

### Specifying `Volumes`

Specifies one or more [`Volumes`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) that the `Steps` in your
`Task` require to execute in addition to volumes that are implicitly created for input and output resources.

For example, you can use `Volumes` to do the following:

- [Mount a Kubernetes `Secret`](auth.md).
- Create an `emptyDir` persistent `Volume` that caches data across multiple `Steps`.
- Mount a [Kubernetes `ConfigMap`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
  as `Volume` source.
- Mount a host's Docker socket to use a `Dockerfile` for building container images.
  **Note:** Building a container image on-cluster using `docker build` is **very
  unsafe** and is mentioned only for the sake of the example. Use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) instead.

### Specifying a `Step` template

The `stepTemplate` field specifies a [`Container`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/)
configuration that will be used as the starting point for all of the `Steps` in your
`Task`. Individual configurations specified within `Steps` supersede the template wherever
overlap occurs.

In the example below, the `Task` specifies a `stepTemplate` field with the environment variable
`FOO` set to `bar`. The first `Step` in the `Task` uses that value for `FOO`, but the second `Step`
overrides the value set in the template with `baz`.

```yaml
stepTemplate:
  env:
    - name: "FOO"
      value: "bar"
steps:
  - image: ubuntu
    command: [echo]
    args: ["FOO is ${FOO}"]
  - image: ubuntu
    command: [echo]
    args: ["FOO is ${FOO}"]
    env:
      - name: "FOO"
        value: "baz"
```

### Specifying `Sidecars`

The `sidecars` field specifies a list of [`Containers`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/)
to run alongside the `Steps` in your `Task`. You can use `Sidecars` to provide auxiliary functionality, such as
[Docker in Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) or running a mock API server that your app can hit during testing.
`Sidecars` spin up before your `Task` executes and are deleted after the `Task` execution completes.
For further information, see [`Sidecars` in `TaskRuns`](taskruns.md#specifying-sidecars).

In the example below, a `Step` uses a Docker-in-Docker `Sidecar` to build a Docker image:

```yaml
steps:
  - image: docker
    name: client
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      cat > Dockerfile << EOF
      FROM ubuntu
      RUN apt-get update
      ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "hello"]
      EOF
      docker build -t hello . && docker run hello
      docker images
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/run/
        name: dind-socket
sidecars:
  - image: docker:18.05-dind
    name: server
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/docker
        name: dind-storage
      - mountPath: /var/run/
        name: dind-socket
volumes:
  - name: dind-storage
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: dind-socket
    emptyDir: {}
```

Sidecars, just like `Steps`, can also run scripts:

```yaml
sidecars:
  - image: busybox
    name: hello-sidecar
    script: |
      echo 'Hello from sidecar!'
```
**Note:** Tekton's current `Sidecar` implementation contains a bug.
Tekton uses a container image named `nop` to terminate `Sidecars`.
That image is configured by passing a flag to the Tekton controller.
If the configured `nop` image contains the exact command the `Sidecar`
was executing before receiving a "stop" signal, the `Sidecar` keeps
running, eventually causing the `TaskRun` to time out with an error.
For more information, see [issue 1347](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1347).

### Adding a description

The `description` field is an optional field that allows you to add an informative description to the `Task`.

### Using variable substitution

Tekton provides variables to inject values into the contents of certain fields.
The values you can inject come from a range of sources including other fields
in the Task, context-sensitive information that Tekton provides, and runtime
information received from a TaskRun.

The mechanism of variable substitution is quite simple - string replacement is
performed by the Tekton Controller when a TaskRun is executed.

`Tasks` allow you to substitute variable names for the following entities:

- [Parameters and resources](#substituting-parameters-and-resources)
- [`Array` parameters](#substituting-array-parameters)
- [`Workspaces`](#substituting-workspace-paths)
- [`Volume` names and types](#substituting-volume-names-and-paths)

See the [complete list of variable substitutions for Tasks](./variables.md#variables-available-in-a-task)
and the [list of fields that accept substitutions](./variables.md#fields-that-accept-variable-substitutions).

#### Substituting parameters and resources

[`params`](#specifying-parameters) and [`resources`](#specifying-resources) attributes can replace
variable values as follows:

- To reference a parameter in a `Task`, use the following syntax, where `<name>` is the name of the parameter:
  ```shell
  # dot notation
  $(params.<name>)
  # or bracket notation (wrapping <name> with either single or double quotes):
  $(params['<name>'])
  $(params["<name>"])
  ```
- To access parameter values from resources, see [variable substitution](resources.md#variable-substitution)

#### Substituting `Array` parameters

You can expand referenced parameters of type `array` using the star operator. To do so, add the operator (`[*]`)
to the named parameter to insert the array elements in the spot of the reference string.

For example, given a `params` field with the contents listed below, you can expand
`command: ["first", "$(params.array-param[*])", "last"]` to `command: ["first", "some", "array", "elements", "last"]`:

```yaml
params:
  - name: array-param
    value:
      - "some"
      - "array"
      - "elements"
```

You **must** reference parameters of type `array` in a completely isolated string within a larger `string` array.
Referencing an `array` parameter in any other way will result in an error. For example, if `build-args` is a parameter of
type `array`, then the following example is an invalid `Step` because the string isn't isolated:

```yaml
- name: build-step
  image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/some-image
  args: ["build", "additionalArg $(params.build-args[*])"]
```

Similarly, referencing `build-args` in a non-`array` field is also invalid:

```yaml
- name: build-step
  image: "$(params.build-args[*])"
  args: ["build", "args"]
```

A valid reference to the `build-args` parameter is isolated and in an eligible field (`args`, in this case):

```yaml
- name: build-step
  image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/some-image
  args: ["build", "$(params.build-args[*])", "additionalArg"]
```

#### Substituting `Workspace` paths

You can substitute paths to `Workspaces` specified within a `Task` as follows:

```yaml
$(workspaces.myworkspace.path)
```

Since the `Volume` name is randomized and only set when the `Task` executes, you can also
substitute the volume name as follows:

```yaml
$(workspaces.myworkspace.volume)
```

#### Substituting `Volume` names and types

You can substitute `Volume` names and [types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes)
by parameterizing them. Tekton supports popular `Volume` types such as `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
See this [example](#mounting-a-configmap-as-a-volume-source) to find out how to perform this type of substitution
in your `Task.`

#### Substituting in `Script` blocks

Variables can contain any string, including snippets of script that can
be injected into a Task's `Script` field. If you are using Tekton's variables
in your Task's `Script` field be aware that the strings you're interpolating
could include executable instructions.

Preventing a substituted variable from executing as code depends on the container
image, language or shell that your Task uses. Here's an example of interpolating
a Tekton variable into a `bash` `Script` block that prevents the variable's string
contents from being executed:

```yaml
# Task.yaml
spec:
  steps:
    - image: an-image-that-runs-bash
      env:
        - name: SCRIPT_CONTENTS
          value: $(params.script)
      script: |
        printf '%s' "${SCRIPT_CONTENTS}" > input-script
```

This works by injecting Tekton's variable as an environment variable into the Step's
container. The `printf` program is then used to write the environment variable's
content to a file.

### Building and pushing a Docker image

The following example `Task` builds and pushes a `Dockerfile`-built image.

**Note:** Building a container image using `docker build` on-cluster is **very
unsafe** and is shown here only as a demonstration. Use [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) instead.

```yaml
spec:
  params:
    # These may be overridden, but provide sensible defaults.
    - name: directory
      type: string
      description: The directory containing the build context.
      default: /workspace
    - name: dockerfileName
      type: string
      description: The name of the Dockerfile
      default: Dockerfile
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: workspace
        type: git
    outputs:
      - name: builtImage
        type: image
  steps:
    - name: dockerfile-build
      image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
      workingDir: "$(params.directory)"
      args:
        [
          "build",
          "--no-cache",
          "--tag",
          "$(resources.outputs.image.url)",
          "--file",
          "$(params.dockerfileName)",
          ".",
        ]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: docker-socket
          mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock

    - name: dockerfile-push
      image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
      args: ["push", "$(resources.outputs.image.url)"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: docker-socket
          mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock

  # As an implementation detail, this Task mounts the host's daemon socket.
  volumes:
    - name: docker-socket
      hostPath:
        path: /var/run/docker.sock
        type: Socket
```

#### Mounting multiple `Volumes`

The example below illustrates mounting multiple `Volumes`:

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
    - image: ubuntu
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        curl https://foo.com > /var/my-volume
      volumeMounts:
        - name: my-volume
          mountPath: /var/my-volume

    - image: ubuntu
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cat /etc/my-volume
      volumeMounts:
        - name: my-volume
          mountPath: /etc/my-volume

  volumes:
    - name: my-volume
      emptyDir: {}
```

#### Mounting a `ConfigMap` as a `Volume` source

The example below illustrates how to mount a `ConfigMap` to act as a `Volume` source:

```yaml
spec:
  params:
    - name: CFGNAME
      type: string
      description: Name of config map
    - name: volumeName
      type: string
      description: Name of volume
  steps:
    - image: ubuntu
      script: |
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cat /var/configmap/test
      volumeMounts:
        - name: "$(params.volumeName)"
          mountPath: /var/configmap

  volumes:
    - name: "$(params.volumeName)"
      configMap:
        name: "$(params.CFGNAME)"
```

#### Using a `Secret` as an environment source

The example below illustrates how to use a `Secret` as an environment source:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: goreleaser
spec:
  params:
    - name: package
      type: string
      description: base package to build in
    - name: github-token-secret
      type: string
      description: name of the secret holding the github-token
      default: github-token
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: source
        type: git
        targetPath: src/$(params.package)
  steps:
    - name: release
      image: goreleaser/goreleaser
      workingDir: /workspace/src/$(params.package)
      command:
        - goreleaser
      args:
        - release
      env:
        - name: GOPATH
          value: /workspace
        - name: GITHUB_TOKEN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: $(params.github-token-secret)
              key: bot-token
```

#### Using a `Sidecar` in a `Task`

The example below illustrates how to use a `Sidecar` in your `Task`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: with-sidecar-task
spec:
  params:
    - name: sidecar-image
      type: string
      description: Image name of the sidecar container
    - name: sidecar-env
      type: string
      description: Environment variable value
  sidecars:
    - name: sidecar
      image: $(params.sidecar-image)
      env:
        - name: SIDECAR_ENV
          value: $(params.sidecar-env)
  steps:
    - name: test
      image: hello-world
```

## Debugging

This section describes techniques for debugging the most common issues in `Tasks`.

### Inspecting the file structure

A common issue when configuring `Tasks` stems from not knowing the location of your data.
For the most part, files ingested and output by your `Task` live in the `/workspace` directory,
but the specifics can vary. To inspect the file structure of your `Task`, add a step that outputs
the name of every file stored in the `/workspace` directory to the build log. For example:

```yaml
- name: build-and-push-1
  image: ubuntu
  command:
    - /bin/bash
  args:
    - -c
    - |
      set -ex
      find /workspace
```

You can also choose to examine the *contents* of every file used by your `Task`:

```yaml
- name: build-and-push-1
  image: ubuntu
  command:
    - /bin/bash
  args:
    - -c
    - |
      set -ex
      find /workspace | xargs cat
```

### Inspecting the `Pod`

To inspect the contents of the `Pod` used by your `Task` at a specific stage in the `Task's` execution,
log into the `Pod` and add a `Step` that pauses the `Task` at the desired stage. For example:

```yaml
- name: pause
  image: docker
  args: ["sleep", "6000"]
```

### Running Step Containers as a Non Root User

All steps that do not require to be run as a root user should make use of TaskRun features to 
designate the container for a step runs as a user without root permissions. As a best practice, 
running containers as non root should be built into the container image to avoid any possibility 
of the container being run as root. However, as a further measure of enforcing this practice, 
steps can make use of a `securityContext` to specify how the container should run.

An example of running Task steps as a non root user is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: show-non-root-steps
spec:
  steps:
    # no securityContext specified so will use
    # securityContext from TaskRun podTemplate
    - name: show-user-1001
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - ps
      args:
        - "aux"
    # securityContext specified so will run as
    # user 2000 instead of 1001
    - name: show-user-2000
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - ps
      args:
        - "aux"
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: show-non-root-steps-run-
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: show-non-root-steps
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1001
```

In the example above, the step `show-user-2000` specifies via a `securityContext` that the container 
for the step should run as user 2000. A `securityContext` must still be specified via a TaskRun `podTemplate` 
for this TaskRun to run in a Kubernetes environment that enforces running containers as non root as a requirement. 

The `runAsNonRoot` property specified via the `podTemplate` above validates that steps part of this TaskRun are 
running as non root users and will fail to start any step container that attempts to run as root. Only specifying 
`runAsNonRoot: true` will not actually run containers as non root as the property simply validates that steps are not 
running as root. It is the `runAsUser` property that is actually used to set the non root user ID for the container.

If a step defines its own `securityContext`, it will be applied for the step container over the `securityContext` 
specified at the pod level via the TaskRun `podTemplate`. 

More information about Pod and Container Security Contexts can be found via the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

The example Task/TaskRun above can be found as a [TaskRun example](../examples/v1beta1/taskruns/run-steps-as-non-root.yaml).
