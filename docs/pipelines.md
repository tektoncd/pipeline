## Overview

A `Pipeline` is a collection of `Tasks` that you define and arrange in a specific order
of execution as part of your continuous integration flow. Each `Task` in a `Pipeline`
executes as a `Pod` on your Kubernetes cluster. You can configure various execution
conditions to fit your business needs.

## Configuring a `Pipeline`

A `Pipeline` definition supports the following fields:

- Required:
  - [`apiVersion`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the API version, for example
    `tekton.dev/v1beta1`.
  - [`kind`][kubernetes-overview] - Identifies this resource object as a `Pipeline` object.
  - [`metadata`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies metadata that uniquely identifies the
    `Pipeline` object. For example, a `name`.
  - [`spec`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the configuration information for
    this `Pipeline` object. This must include:
      - [`tasks`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline) - Specifies the `Tasks` that comprise the `Pipeline`
        and the details of their execution.
- Optional:
  - [`params`](#specifying-parameters) - Specifies the `Parameters` that the `Pipeline` requires.
  - [`workspaces`](#specifying-workspaces) - Specifies a set of Workspaces that the `Pipeline` requires.
  - [`tasks`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline):
      - [`name`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline) - the name of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
      - [`displayName`](#specifying-a-display-name) - a user-facing name of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
      - [`description`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline) - a description of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
      - [`taskRef`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline) - a reference to a `Task` definition.
      - [`taskSpec`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline) - a specification of a `Task`.
      - [`runAfter`](#using-the-runafter-field) - Indicates that a `Task` should execute after one or more other
        `Tasks` without output linking.
      - [`retries`](#using-the-retries-field) - Specifies the number of times to retry the execution of a `Task` after
        a failure. Does not apply to execution cancellations.
      - [`when`](#guard-finally-task-execution-using-when-expressions) - Specifies `when` expressions that guard
        the execution of a `Task`; allow execution only when all `when` expressions evaluate to true.
      - [`timeout`](#configuring-the-failure-timeout) - Specifies the timeout before a `Task` fails.
      - [`params`](#specifying-parameters-in-pipelinetasks) - Specifies the `Parameters` that a `Task` requires.
      - [`workspaces`](#specifying-workspaces-in-pipelinetasks) - Specifies the `Workspaces` that a `Task` requires.
      - [`matrix`](#specifying-matrix-in-pipelinetasks) - Specifies the `Parameters` used to fan out a `Task` into
        multiple `TaskRuns` or `Runs`.
  - [`results`](#emitting-results-from-a-pipeline) - Specifies the location to which the `Pipeline` emits its execution
    results.
  - [`displayName`](#specifying-a-display-name) - is a user-facing name of the pipeline that may be used to populate a UI.
  - [`description`](#adding-a-description) - Holds an informative description of the `Pipeline` object.
  - [`finally`](#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline) - Specifies one or more `Tasks` to be executed in parallel after
    all other tasks have completed.
    - [`name`](#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline) - the name of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
    - [`displayName`](#specifying-a-display-name) - a user-facing name of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
    - [`description`](#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline) - a description of this `Task` within the context of this `Pipeline`.
    - [`taskRef`](#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline) - a reference to a `Task` definition.
    - [`taskSpec`](#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline) - a specification of a `Task`.
    - [`retries`](#using-the-retries-field) - Specifies the number of times to retry the execution of a `Task` after
      a failure. Does not apply to execution cancellations.
    - [`when`](#guard-finally-task-execution-using-when-expressions) - Specifies `when` expressions that guard
      the execution of a `Task`; allow execution only when all `when` expressions evaluate to true.
    - [`timeout`](#configuring-the-failure-timeout) - Specifies the timeout before a `Task` fails.
    - [`params`](#specifying-parameters-in-finally-tasks) - Specifies the `Parameters` that a `Task` requires.
    - [`workspaces`](#specifying-workspaces-in-finally-tasks) - Specifies the `Workspaces` that a `Task` requires.
    - [`matrix`](#specifying-matrix-in-finally-tasks) - Specifies the `Parameters` used to fan out a `Task` into
      multiple `TaskRuns` or `Runs`.

## Specifying `Workspaces`

`Workspaces` allow you to specify one or more volumes that each `Task` in the `Pipeline`
requires during execution. You specify one or more `Workspaces` in the `workspaces` field.
For example:

```yaml
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: pipeline-ws1 # The name of the workspace in the Pipeline
  tasks:
    - name: use-ws-from-pipeline
      taskRef:
        name: gen-code # gen-code expects a workspace with name "output"
      workspaces:
        - name: output
          workspace: pipeline-ws1
    - name: use-ws-again
      taskRef:
        name: commit # commit expects a workspace with name "src"
      runAfter:
        - use-ws-from-pipeline # important: use-ws-from-pipeline writes to the workspace first
      workspaces:
        - name: src
          workspace: pipeline-ws1
```

For simplicity you can also map the name of the `Workspace` in `PipelineTask` to match with
the `Workspace` from the `Pipeline`.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: pipeline
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: source
  tasks:
    - name: gen-code
      taskRef:
        name: gen-code # gen-code expects a Workspace named "source"
      workspaces:
        - name: source # <- mapping workspace name
    - name: commit
      taskRef:
        name: commit # commit expects a Workspace named "source"
      workspaces:
        - name: source # <- mapping workspace name
      runAfter:
        - gen-code
```

For more information, see:
- [Using `Workspaces` in `Pipelines`](workspaces.md#using-workspaces-in-pipelines)
- The [`Workspaces` in a `PipelineRun`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/workspaces.yaml) code example
- The [variables available in a `PipelineRun`](variables.md#variables-available-in-a-pipeline), including `workspaces.<name>.bound`.
- [Mapping `Workspaces`](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0108-mapping-workspaces.md)

## Specifying `Parameters`

(See also [Specifying Parameters in Tasks](tasks.md#specifying-parameters))

You can specify global parameters, such as compilation flags or artifact names, that you want to supply
to the `Pipeline` at execution time. `Parameters` are passed to the `Pipeline` from its corresponding
`PipelineRun` and can replace template values specified within each `Task` in the `Pipeline`.

Parameter names:
- Must only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`).
- Must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`).

For example, `fooIs-Bar_` is a valid parameter name, but `barIsBa$` or `0banana` are not.

Each declared parameter has a `type` field, which can be set to either `array` or `string`.
`array` is useful in cases where the number of compilation flags being supplied to the `Pipeline`
varies throughout its execution. If no value is specified, the `type` field defaults to `string`.
When the actual parameter value is supplied, its parsed type is validated against the `type` field.
The `description` and `default` fields for a `Parameter` are optional.

The following example illustrates the use of `Parameters` in a `Pipeline`.

The following `Pipeline` declares two input parameters :

- `context` which passes its value (a string) to the `Task` to set the value of the `pathToContext` parameter within the `Task`.
- `flags` which passes its value (an array) to the `Task` to set the value of
  the `flags` parameter within the `Task`. The `flags` parameter within the
`Task` **must** also be an array.
If you specify a value for the `default` field and invoke this `Pipeline` in a `PipelineRun`
without specifying a value for `context`, that value will be used.

**Note:** Input parameter values can be used as variables throughout the `Pipeline`
by using [variable substitution](variables.md#variables-available-in-a-pipeline).

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: pipeline-with-parameters
spec:
  params:
    - name: context
      type: string
      description: Path to context
      default: /some/where/or/other
    - name: flags
      type: array
      description: List of flags
  tasks:
    - name: build-skaffold-web
      taskRef:
        name: build-push
      params:
        - name: pathToDockerFile
          value: Dockerfile
        - name: pathToContext
          value: "$(params.context)"
        - name: flags
          value: ["$(params.flags[*])"]
```

The following `PipelineRun` supplies a value for `context`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pipelinerun-with-parameters
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: pipeline-with-parameters
  params:
    - name: "context"
      value: "/workspace/examples/microservices/leeroy-web"
    - name: "flags"
      value:
        - "foo"
        - "bar"
```

## Adding `Tasks` to the `Pipeline`

 Your `Pipeline` definition must reference at least one [`Task`](tasks.md).
Each `Task` within a `Pipeline` must have a [valid](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names)
`name` and a `taskRef` or a `taskSpec`. For example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: build-the-image
    taskRef:
      name: build-push
```

**Note:** Using both `apiVersion` and `kind` will create [CustomRun](customruns.md), don't set `apiVersion` if only referring to [`Task`](tasks.md).

or

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: say-hello
    taskSpec:
      steps:
      - image: ubuntu
        script: echo 'hello there'
```

Note that any `task` specified in `taskSpec` will be the same version as the `Pipeline`.

### Specifying Remote Tasks

**([beta feature](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/install.md#beta-features))**

A `taskRef` field may specify a Task in a remote location such as git.
Support for specific types of remote will depend on the Resolvers your
cluster's operator has installed. For more information including a tutorial, please check [resolution docs](resolution.md). The below example demonstrates referencing a Task in git:

```yaml
tasks:
- name: "go-build"
  taskRef:
    resolver: git
    params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog.git
    - name: revision
      # value can use params declared at the pipeline level or a static value like main
      value: $(params.gitRevision)
    - name: pathInRepo
      value: task/golang-build/0.3/golang-build.yaml
```

### Specifying `Pipelines` in `PipelineTasks`

> :seedling: **Specifying `pipelines` in `PipelineTasks` is an [alpha](additional-configs.md#alpha-features) feature.**
> The `enable-api-fields` feature flag must be set to `"alpha"` to specify `PipelineRef` or `PipelineSpec` in a `PipelineTask`.
> This feature is in **Preview Only** mode and not yet supported/implemented.

Apart from `taskRef` and `taskSpec`, `pipelineRef` and `pipelineSpec` allows you to specify a `pipeline`  in `pipelineTask`.
This allows you to generate a child `pipelineRun` which is inherited by the parent `pipelineRun`.

```
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: security-scans
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: scorecards
      taskSpec:
        steps:
          - image: alpine
            name: step-1
            script: |
              echo "Generating scorecard report ..."
    - name: codeql
      taskSpec:
        steps:
          - image: alpine
            name: step-1
            script: |
              echo "Generating codeql report ..."
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: clone-scan-notify
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: git-clone
      taskSpec:
        steps:
          - image: alpine
            name: step-1
            script: |
              echo "Cloning a repo to run security scans ..."
    - name: security-scans
      runAfter:
        - git-clone
      pipelineRef:
        name: security-scans
---
```
For further information read [Pipelines in Pipelines](./pipelines-in-pipelines.md)


### Specifying `Parameters` in `PipelineTasks`

You can also provide [`Parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters):

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: build-skaffold-web
      taskRef:
        name: build-push
      params:
        - name: pathToDockerFile
          value: Dockerfile
        - name: pathToContext
          value: /workspace/examples/microservices/leeroy-web
```

### Specifying `Matrix` in `PipelineTasks`

> :seedling: **`Matrix` is an [beta](additional-configs.md#beta-features) feature.**
> The `enable-api-fields` feature flag can be set to `"beta"` to specify `Matrix` in a `PipelineTask`.

You can also provide [`Parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters) through the `matrix` field:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: browser-test
      taskRef:
        name: browser-test
      matrix:
        params:
        - name: browser
          value:
          - chrome
          - safari
          - firefox
        include:
          - name: build-1
            params:
              - name: browser
                value: chrome
              - name: url
                value: some-url
```

For further information, read [`Matrix`](./matrix.md).

### Specifying `Workspaces` in `PipelineTasks`

You can also provide [`Workspaces`](tasks.md#specifying-workspaces):

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: use-workspace
      taskRef:
        name: gen-code # gen-code expects a workspace with name "output"
      workspaces:
        - name: output
          workspace: shared-ws
```

### Tekton Bundles

A `Tekton Bundle` is an OCI artifact that contains Tekton resources like `Tasks` which can be referenced within a `taskRef`.

There is currently a hard limit of 20 objects in a bundle.

You can reference a `Tekton bundle` in a `TaskRef` in both `v1` and `v1beta1` using [remote resolution](./bundle-resolver.md#pipeline-resolution). The example syntax shown below for `v1` uses remote resolution and requires enabling [beta features](./additional-configs.md#beta-features).

In `v1beta1`, you can also reference a `Tekton bundle` using OCI bundle syntax, which has been deprecated in favor of remote resolution. The example shown below for `v1beta1` uses OCI bundle syntax, and requires enabling `enable-tekton-oci-bundles: "true"` feature flag.


{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "v1 & v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: hello-world
      taskRef:
        name: echo-task
        bundle: docker.com/myrepo/mycatalog
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Here, the `bundle` field is the full reference url to the artifact. The name is the
`metadata.name` field of the `Task`.

You may also specify a `tag` as you would with a Docker image which will give you a fixed,
repeatable reference to a `Task`.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "v1 & v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog:v1.0.1
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: hello-world
      taskRef:
        name: echo-task
        bundle: docker.com/myrepo/mycatalog:v1.0.1
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

You may also specify a fixed digest instead of a tag.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "v1 & v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog@sha256:abc123
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: hello-world
      taskRef:
        name: echo-task
        bundle: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog@sha256:abc123
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Any of the above options will fetch the image using the `ImagePullSecrets` attached to the
`ServiceAccount` specified in the `PipelineRun`.
See the [Service Account](pipelineruns.md#specifying-custom-serviceaccount-credentials) section
for details on how to configure a `ServiceAccount` on a `PipelineRun`. The `PipelineRun` will then
run that `Task` without registering it in the cluster allowing multiple versions of the same named
`Task` to be run at once.

`Tekton Bundles` may be constructed with any toolsets that produce valid OCI image artifacts
so long as the artifact adheres to the [contract](tekton-bundle-contracts.md).

### Using the `runAfter` field

If you need your `Tasks` to execute in a specific order within the `Pipeline`,
use the `runAfter` field to indicate that a `Task` must execute after
one or more other `Tasks`.

In the example below, we want to test the code before we build it. Since there
is no output from the `test-app` `Task`, the `build-app` `Task` uses `runAfter`
to indicate that `test-app` must run before it, regardless of the order in which
they are referenced in the `Pipeline` definition.

```yaml
workspaces:
- name: source
tasks:
- name: test-app
  taskRef:
    name: make-test
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    workspace: source
- name: build-app
  taskRef:
    name: kaniko-build
  runAfter:
    - test-app
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    workspace: source
```

### Using the `retries` field

For each `Task` in the `Pipeline`, you can specify the number of times Tekton
should retry its execution when it fails. When a `Task` fails, the corresponding
`TaskRun` sets its `Succeeded` `Condition` to `False`. The `retries` field
instructs Tekton to retry executing the `Task` when this happens. `retries` are executed
even when other `Task`s in the `Pipeline` have failed, unless the `PipelineRun` has
been [cancelled](./pipelineruns.md#cancelling-a-pipelinerun) or
[gracefully cancelled](./pipelineruns.md#gracefully-cancelling-a-pipelinerun).

If you expect a `Task` to encounter problems during execution (for example,
you know that there will be issues with network connectivity or missing
dependencies), set its `retries` field to a suitable value greater than 0.
If you don't explicitly specify a value, Tekton does not attempt to execute
the failed `Task` again.

In the example below, the execution of the `build-the-image` `Task` will be
retried once after a failure; if the retried execution fails, too, the `Task`
execution fails as a whole.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: build-the-image
    retries: 1
    taskRef:
      name: build-push
```

### Using the `onError` field

> :seedling: **Specifying `onError` in `PipelineTasks` is an [alpha](additional-configs.md#alpha-features) feature.** The `enable-api-fields` feature flag must be set to `"alpha"` to specify `onError`  in a `PipelineTask`.

> :seedling: This feature is in **Preview Only** mode and not yet supported/implemented.

When a `PipelineTask` fails, the rest of the `PipelineTasks` are skipped and the `PipelineRun` is declared a failure. If you would like to
ignore such `PipelineTask` failure and continue executing the rest of the `PipelineTasks`, you can specify `onError` for such a `PipelineTask`.

`OnError` can be set to `stopAndFail` (default) and `continue`. The failure of a `PipelineTask` with `stopAndFail` would stop and fail the whole `PipelineRun`.  A `PipelineTask` fails with `continue` does not fail the whole `PipelineRun`, and the rest of the `PipelineTask` will continue to execute.

To ignore a `PipelineTask` failure, set `onError` to `continue`:

``` yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      onError: continue
      taskSpec:
        steps:
          - name: step1
            image: alpine
            script: |
              exit 1
```

At runtime, the failure is ignored to determine the `PipelineRun` status. The `PipelineRun` `message` contains the ignored failure info:

``` yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-09-28T19:08:30Z"
    message: 'Tasks Completed: 1 (Failed: 1 (Ignored: 1), Cancelled 0), Skipped: 0'
    reason: Succeeded
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
  ...
```

Note that the `TaskRun` status remains as it is irrelevant to `OnError`. Failed but ignored `TaskRuns` result in a `failed` status with reason
`FailureIgnored`.

For example, the `TaskRun` created by the above `PipelineRun` has the following status:

``` bash
$ kubectl get tr demo-run-task1
NAME                                SUCCEEDED   REASON           STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
demo-run-task1                      False       FailureIgnored   12m         12m
```

To specify `onError` for a `step`, please see [specifying onError for a step](./tasks.md#specifying-onerror-for-a-step).

**Note:** Setting [`Retry`](#specifying-retries) and `OnError:continue` at the same time is **NOT** allowed.

### Produce results with `OnError`

When a `PipelineTask` is set to ignore error and the `PipelineTask` is able to initialize a result before failing, the result is made available to the consumer `PipelineTasks`.

``` yaml
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      onError: continue
      taskSpec:
        results:
          - name: result1
        steps:
          - name: step1
            image: alpine
            script: |
              echo -n 123 | tee $(results.result1.path)
              exit 1
```

The consumer `PipelineTasks` can access the result by referencing `$(tasks.task1.results.result1)`.

If the result is **NOT** initialized before failing, and there is a `PipelineTask` consuming it:

``` yaml
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      onError: continue
      taskSpec:
        results:
          - name: result1
        steps:
          - name: step1
            image: alpine
            script: |
              exit 1
              echo -n 123 | tee $(results.result1.path)
```

- If the consuming `PipelineTask` has `OnError:stopAndFail`, the `PipelineRun` will fail with `InvalidTaskResultReference`.
- If the consuming `PipelineTask` has `OnError:continue`, the consuming `PipelineTask` will be skipped with reason `Results were missing`,
and the `PipelineRun` will continue to execute.

### Guard `Task` execution using `when` expressions

To run a `Task` only when certain conditions are met, it is possible to _guard_ task execution using the `when` field. The `when` field allows you to list a series of references to `when` expressions.

The components of `when` expressions are `input`, `operator` and `values`:

| Component  | Description                                                                                                | Syntax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `input`    | Input for the `when` expression, defaults to an empty string if not provided.                              | * Static values e.g. `"ubuntu"`<br/> * Variables ([parameters](#specifying-parameters) or [results](#using-results)) e.g. `"$(params.image)"` or `"$(tasks.task1.results.image)"` or `"$(tasks.task1.results.array-results[1])"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `operator` | `operator` represents an `input`'s relationship to a set of `values`, a valid `operator` must be provided. | `in` or `notin`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `values`   | An array of string values, the `values` array must be provided and has to be non-empty.                    | * An array param e.g. `["$(params.images[*])"]`<br/> * An array result of a task `["$(tasks.task1.results.array-results[*])"]`<br/> * `values` can contain static values e.g. `"ubuntu"`<br/> * `values` can contain variables ([parameters](#specifying-parameters) or [results](#using-results)) or [a Workspaces's `bound` state](#specifying-workspaces) e.g. `["$(params.image)"]` or `["$(tasks.task1.results.image)"]` or `["$(tasks.task1.results.array-results[1])"]` |


The [`Parameters`](#specifying-parameters) are read from the `Pipeline` and [`Results`](#using-results) are read directly from previous [`Tasks`](#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline). Using [`Results`](#using-results) in a `when` expression in a guarded `Task` introduces a resource dependency on the previous `Task` that produced the `Result`.

The declared `when` expressions are evaluated before the `Task` is run. If all the `when` expressions evaluate to `True`, the `Task` is run. If any of the `when` expressions evaluate to `False`, the `Task` is not run and the `Task` is listed in the [`Skipped Tasks` section of the `PipelineRunStatus`](pipelineruns.md#monitoring-execution-status).

In these examples, `first-create-file` task will only be executed if the `path` parameter is `README.md`, `echo-file-exists` task will only be executed if the `exists` result from `check-file` task is `yes` and `run-lint` task will only be executed if the `lint-config` optional workspace has been provided by a PipelineRun.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: first-create-file
    when:
      - input: "$(params.path)"
        operator: in
        values: ["README.md"]
    taskRef:
      name: first-create-file
---
tasks:
  - name: echo-file-exists
    when:
      - input: "$(tasks.check-file.results.exists)"
        operator: in
        values: ["yes"]
    taskRef:
      name: echo-file-exists
---
tasks:
  - name: run-lint
    when:
      - input: "$(workspaces.lint-config.bound)"
        operator: in
        values: ["true"]
    taskRef:
      name: lint-source
---
tasks:
  - name: deploy-in-blue
    when:
      - input: "blue"
        operator: in
        values: ["$(params.deployments[*])"]
    taskRef:
      name: deployment
```

For an end-to-end example, see [PipelineRun with `when` expressions](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-with-when-expressions.yaml).

There are a lot of scenarios where `when` expressions can be really useful. Some of these are:
- Checking if the name of a git branch matches
- Checking if the `Result` of a previous `Task` is as expected
- Checking if a git file has changed in the previous commits
- Checking if an image exists in the registry
- Checking if the name of a CI job matches
- Checking if an optional Workspace has been provided

#### Use CEL expression in WhenExpression

> :seedling: **`CEL in WhenExpression` is an [alpha](additional-configs.md#alpha-features) feature.**
> The `enable-cel-in-whenexpression` feature flag must be set to `"true"` to enable the use of `CEL` in `WhenExpression`.
>
> :warning: This feature is in a preview mode.
> It is still in a very early stage of development and is not yet fully functional

`CEL` expression is validated at admission webhook and a validation error will be returned if the expression is invalid.

**Note:** To use Tekton's [variable substitution](variables.md), you need to wrap the reference with single quotes. This also means that if you pass another CEL expression via `params` or `results`, it won't be executed. Therefore CEL injection is disallowed.

For example:
```
This is valid: '$(params.foo)' == 'foo'
This is invalid: $(params.foo) == 'foo'
CEL's variable substitution is not supported yet and thus invalid: params.foo == 'foo'
```

#### Guarding a `Task` and its dependent `Tasks`

To guard a `Task` and its dependent Tasks:
- cascade the `when` expressions to the specific dependent `Tasks` to be guarded as well
- compose the `Task` and its dependent `Tasks` as a unit to be guarded and executed together using `Pipelines` in `Pipelines`

##### Cascade `when` expressions to the specific dependent `Tasks`

Pick and choose which specific dependent `Tasks` to guard as well, and cascade the `when` expressions to those `Tasks`.

Taking the use case below, a user who wants to guard `manual-approval` and its dependent `Tasks`:

```
                                     tests
                                       |
                                       v
                                 manual-approval
                                 |            |
                                 v        (approver)
                            build-image       |
                                |             v
                                v          slack-msg
                            deploy-image
```

The user can design the `Pipeline` to solve their use case as such:

```yaml
tasks:
#...
- name: manual-approval
  runAfter:
    - tests
  when:
    - input: $(params.git-action)
      operator: in
      values:
        - merge
  taskRef:
    name: manual-approval

- name: build-image
  when:
    - input: $(params.git-action)
      operator: in
      values:
        - merge
  runAfter:
    - manual-approval
  taskRef:
    name: build-image

- name: deploy-image
  when:
    - input: $(params.git-action)
      operator: in
      values:
        - merge
  runAfter:
    - build-image
  taskRef:
    name: deploy-image

- name: slack-msg
  params:
    - name: approver
      value: $(tasks.manual-approval.results.approver)
  taskRef:
    name: slack-msg
```

##### Compose using Pipelines in Pipelines

Compose a set of `Tasks` as a unit of execution using `Pipelines` in `Pipelines`, which allows for guarding a `Task` and
its dependent `Tasks` (as a sub-`Pipeline`) using `when` expressions.

**Note:** `Pipelines` in `Pipelines` is an [experimental feature](https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/tree/main/pipelines-in-pipelines)

Taking the use case below, a user who wants to guard `manual-approval` and its dependent `Tasks`:

```
                                     tests
                                       |
                                       v
                                 manual-approval
                                 |            |
                                 v        (approver)
                            build-image       |
                                |             v
                                v          slack-msg
                            deploy-image
```

The user can design the `Pipelines` to solve their use case as such:

```yaml
## sub pipeline (approve-build-deploy-slack)
tasks:
  - name: manual-approval
    runAfter:
      - integration-tests
    taskRef:
      name: manual-approval

  - name: build-image
    runAfter:
      - manual-approval
    taskRef:
      name: build-image

  - name: deploy-image
    runAfter:
      - build-image
    taskRef:
      name: deploy-image

  - name: slack-msg
    params:
      - name: approver
        value: $(tasks.manual-approval.results.approver)
    taskRef:
      name: slack-msg

---
## main pipeline
tasks:
#...
- name: approve-build-deploy-slack
  runAfter:
    - tests
  when:
    - input: $(params.git-action)
      operator: in
      values:
        - merge
  taskRef:
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    name: approve-build-deploy-slack
```

#### Guarding a `Task` only

When `when` expressions evaluate to `False`, the `Task` will be skipped and:
- The ordering-dependent `Tasks` will be executed
- The resource-dependent `Tasks` (and their dependencies) will be skipped because of missing `Results` from the skipped
  parent `Task`. When we add support for [default `Results`](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/pull/240), then the
  resource-dependent `Tasks` may be executed if the default `Results` from the skipped parent `Task` are specified. In
  addition, if a resource-dependent `Task` needs a file from a guarded parent `Task` in a shared `Workspace`, make sure
  to handle the execution of the child `Task` in case the expected file is missing from the `Workspace` because the
  guarded parent `Task` is skipped.

On the other hand, the rest of the `Pipeline` will continue executing.

```
                                     tests
                                       |
                                       v
                                 manual-approval
                                 |            |
                                 v        (approver)
                            build-image       |
                                |             v
                                v          slack-msg
                            deploy-image
```

Taking the use case above, a user who wants to guard `manual-approval` only can design the `Pipeline` as such:

```yaml
tasks:
#...
- name: manual-approval
  runAfter:
    - tests
  when:
    - input: $(params.git-action)
      operator: in
      values:
        - merge
  taskRef:
    name: manual-approval

- name: build-image
  runAfter:
    - manual-approval
  taskRef:
    name: build-image

- name: deploy-image
  runAfter:
    - build-image
  taskRef:
    name: deploy-image

- name: slack-msg
  params:
    - name: approver
      value: $(tasks.manual-approval.results.approver)
  taskRef:
    name: slack-msg
```

If `manual-approval` is skipped, execution of its dependent `Tasks` (`slack-msg`, `build-image` and `deploy-image`)
would be unblocked regardless:
- `build-image` and `deploy-image` should be executed successfully
- `slack-msg` will be skipped because it is missing the `approver` `Result` from `manual-approval`
  - dependents of `slack-msg` would have been skipped too if it had any of them
  - if `manual-approval` specifies a default `approver` `Result`, such as "None", then `slack-msg` would be executed
    ([supporting default `Results` is in progress](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/pull/240))

### Configuring the failure timeout

You can use the `Timeout` field in the `Task` spec within the `Pipeline` to set the timeout
of the `TaskRun` that executes that `Task` within the `PipelineRun` that executes your `Pipeline.`
The `Timeout` value is a `duration` conforming to Go's [`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)
format. For example, valid values are `1h30m`, `1h`, `1m`, and `60s`.

**Note:** If you do not specify a `Timeout` value, Tekton instead honors the timeout for the [`PipelineRun`](pipelineruns.md#configuring-a-pipelinerun).

In the example below, the `build-the-image` `Task` is configured to time out after 90 seconds:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: build-the-image
      taskRef:
        name: build-push
      timeout: "0h1m30s"
```

## Using variable substitution

Tekton provides variables to inject values into the contents of certain fields.
The values you can inject come from a range of sources including other fields
in the Pipeline, context-sensitive information that Tekton provides, and runtime
information received from a PipelineRun.

The mechanism of variable substitution is quite simple - string replacement is
performed by the Tekton Controller when a PipelineRun is executed.

See the [complete list of variable substitutions for Pipelines](./variables.md#variables-available-in-a-pipeline)
and the [list of fields that accept substitutions](./variables.md#fields-that-accept-variable-substitutions).

For an end-to-end example, see [using context variables](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/using_context_variables.yaml).

### Using the `retries` and `retry-count` variable substitutions

Tekton supports variable substitution for the [`retries`](#using-the-retries-field)
parameter of `PipelineTask`. Variables like `context.pipelineTask.retries` and
`context.task.retry-count` can be added to the parameters of a `PipelineTask`.
`context.pipelineTask.retries` will be replaced by `retries` of the `PipelineTask`, while
`context.task.retry-count` will be replaced by current retry number of the `PipelineTask`.

```yaml
params:
- name: pipelineTask-retries
  value: "$(context.pipelineTask.retries)"
taskSpec:
  params:
  - name: pipelineTask-retries
  steps:
  - image: ubuntu
    name: print-if-retries-exhausted
    script: |
      if [ "$(context.task.retry-count)" == "$(params.pipelineTask-retries)" ]
      then
        echo "This is the last retry."
      fi
      exit 1
```

**Note:** Every `PipelineTask` can only access its own `retries` and `retry-count`. These
values aren't accessible for other `PipelineTask`s.

## Using `Results`

Tasks can emit [`Results`](tasks.md#emitting-results) when they execute. A Pipeline can use these
`Results` for two different purposes:

1. A Pipeline can pass the `Result` of a `Task` into the `Parameters` or `when` expressions of another.
2. A Pipeline can itself emit `Results` and include data from the `Results` of its Tasks.

### Passing one Task's `Results` into the `Parameters` or `when` expressions of another

Sharing `Results` between `Tasks` in a `Pipeline` happens via
[variable substitution](variables.md#variables-available-in-a-pipeline) - one `Task` emits
a `Result` and another receives it as a `Parameter` with a variable such as
`$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>)`. Pipeline support two new types of
results and parameters: array `[]string` and object `map[string]string`.
Array and Object result is a beta feature and can be enabled by setting `enable-api-fields` to `alpha` or `beta`.

| Result Type | Parameter Type | Specification                                    | `enable-api-fields` |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| string      | string         | `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>)`     | stable              |
| array       | array          | `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>[*])`  | alpha or beta       |
| array       | string         | `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>[i])`  | alpha or beta       |
| object      | object         | `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>[*])`  | alpha or beta              |
| object      | string         | `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>.key)` | alpha or beta              |

**Note:** Whole Array and Object `Results` (using star notation) cannot be referred in `script`.

When one `Task` receives the `Results` of another, there is a dependency created between those
two `Tasks`. In order for the receiving `Task` to get data from another `Task's` `Result`,
the `Task` producing the `Result` must run first. Tekton enforces this `Task` ordering
by ensuring that the `Task` emitting the `Result` executes before any `Task` that uses it.

In the snippet below, a param is provided its value from the `commit` `Result` emitted by the
`checkout-source` `Task`. Tekton will make sure that the `checkout-source` `Task` runs
before this one.

```yaml
params:
  - name: foo
    value: "$(tasks.checkout-source.results.commit)"
  - name: array-params
    value: "$(tasks.checkout-source.results.array-results[*])"
  - name: array-indexing-params
    value: "$(tasks.checkout-source.results.array-results[1])"
  - name: object-params
    value: "$(tasks.checkout-source.results.object-results[*])"
  - name: object-element-params
    value: "$(tasks.checkout-source.results.object-results.objectkey)"
```

**Note:** If `checkout-source` exits successfully without initializing `commit` `Result`,
the receiving `Task` fails and causes the `Pipeline` to fail with `InvalidTaskResultReference`:

```
unable to find result referenced by param 'foo' in 'task';: Could not find result with name 'commit' for task run 'checkout-source'
```

In the snippet below, a `when` expression is provided its value from the `exists` `Result` emitted by the
`check-file` `Task`. Tekton will make sure that the `check-file` `Task` runs before this one.

```yaml
when:
  - input: "$(tasks.check-file.results.exists)"
    operator: in
    values: ["yes"]
```

For an end-to-end example, see [`Task` `Results` in a `PipelineRun`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/task_results_example.yaml).

Note that `when` expressions are whitespace-sensitive.  In particular, when producing results intended for inputs to `when`
expressions that may include newlines at their close (e.g. `cat`, `jq`), you may wish to truncate them.

```yaml
taskSpec:
  params:
  - name: jsonQuery-check
  steps:
  - image: ubuntu
    name: store-name-in-results
    script: |
      curl -s https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/profile | jq -r .name | tr -d '\n' | tee $(results.name.path)
```

### Emitting `Results` from a `Pipeline`

A `Pipeline` can emit `Results` of its own for a variety of reasons - an external
system may need to read them when the `Pipeline` is complete, they might summarise
the most important `Results` from the `Pipeline's` `Tasks`, or they might simply
be used to expose non-critical messages generated during the execution of the `Pipeline`.

A `Pipeline's` `Results` can be composed of one or many `Task` `Results` emitted during
the course of the `Pipeline's` execution. A `Pipeline` `Result` can refer to its `Tasks'`
`Results` using a variable of the form `$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>)`.

After a `Pipeline` has executed the `PipelineRun` will be populated with the `Results`
emitted by the `Pipeline`. These will be written to the `PipelineRun's`
`status.pipelineResults` field.

In the example below, the `Pipeline` specifies a `results` entry with the name `sum` that
references the `outputValue` `Result` emitted by the `calculate-sum` `Task`.

```yaml
results:
  - name: sum
    description: the sum of all three operands
    value: $(tasks.calculate-sum.results.outputValue)
```

For an end-to-end example, see [`Results` in a `PipelineRun`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-results.yaml).

Object result and array result are beta features,
see [`Array and Object Results` in a `PipelineRun`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/beta/pipeline-emitting-results.yaml).

```yaml
    results:
      - name: array-results
        type: array
        description: whole array
        value: $(tasks.task1.results.array-results[*])
      - name: array-indexing-results
        type: string
        description: array element
        value: $(tasks.task1.results.array-results[1])
      - name: object-results
        type: object
        description: whole object
        value: $(tasks.task2.results.object-results[*])
      - name: object-element
        type: string
        description: object element
        value: $(tasks.task2.results.object-results.foo)
```


A `Pipeline Result` is not emitted if any of the following are true:
- A `PipelineTask` referenced by the `Pipeline Result` failed. The `PipelineRun` will also
have failed.
- A `PipelineTask` referenced by the `Pipeline Result` was skipped.
- A `PipelineTask` referenced by the `Pipeline Result` didn't emit the referenced `Task Result`. This
should be considered a bug in the `Task` and [may fail a `PipelineTask` in future](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/3497).
- The `Pipeline Result` uses a variable that doesn't point to an actual `PipelineTask`. This will
result in an `InvalidTaskResultReference` validation error during `PipelineRun` execution.
- The `Pipeline Result` uses a variable that doesn't point to an actual result in a `PipelineTask`.
This will cause an `InvalidTaskResultReference` validation error during `PipelineRun` execution.

**Note:** Since a `Pipeline Result` can contain references to multiple `Task Results`, if any of those
`Task Result` references are invalid the entire `Pipeline Result` is not emitted.
**Note:** If a `PipelineTask` referenced by the `Pipeline Result` was skipped, the `Pipeline Result` will not be emitted and the `PipelineRun` will not fail due to a missing result.

## Configuring the `Task` execution order

You can connect `Tasks` in a `Pipeline` so that they execute in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
Each `Task` in the `Pipeline` becomes a node on the graph that can be connected with an edge
so that one will run before another and the execution of the `Pipeline` progresses to completion
without getting stuck in an infinite loop.

This is done using:
- _resource dependencies_:
  - [`results`](#emitting-results-from-a-pipeline) of one `Task` being passed into `params` or `when` expressions of
    another

- _ordering dependencies_:
  - [`runAfter`](#using-the-runafter-field) clauses on the corresponding `Tasks`

For example, the `Pipeline` defined as follows

```yaml
tasks:
- name: lint-repo
  taskRef:
    name: pylint
- name: test-app
  taskRef:
    name: make-test
- name: build-app
  taskRef:
    name: kaniko-build-app
  runAfter:
    - test-app
- name: build-frontend
  taskRef:
    name: kaniko-build-frontend
  runAfter:
    - test-app
- name: deploy-all
  taskRef:
    name: deploy-kubectl
  runAfter:
    - build-app
    - build-frontend
```

executes according to the following graph:

```none
        |            |
        v            v
     test-app    lint-repo
    /        \
   v          v
build-app  build-frontend
   \          /
    v        v
    deploy-all
```

In particular:

1. The `lint-repo` and `test-app` `Tasks` have no `runAfter` clauses
   and start executing simultaneously.
2. Once `test-app` completes, both `build-app` and `build-frontend` start
   executing simultaneously since they both `runAfter` the `test-app` `Task`.
3. The `deploy-all` `Task` executes once both `build-app` and `build-frontend`
   complete, since it is supposed to `runAfter` them both.
4. The entire `Pipeline` completes execution once both `lint-repo` and `deploy-all`
   complete execution.

## Specifying a display name

The `displayName` field is an optional field that allows you to add a user-facing name of the `Pipeline` that can be used to populate a UI. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  displayName: "Code Scan"
  tasks:
    - name: scan
      taskRef:
        name: sonar-scan
```

## Adding a description

The `description` field is an optional field and can be used to provide description of the `Pipeline`.

## Adding `Finally` to the `Pipeline`

You can specify a list of one or more final tasks under `finally` section. `finally` tasks are guaranteed to be executed
in parallel after all `PipelineTasks` under `tasks` have completed regardless of success or error. `finally` tasks are very
similar to `PipelineTasks` under `tasks` section and follow the same syntax. Each `finally` task must have a
[valid](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names) `name` and a [taskRef or
taskSpec](taskruns.md#specifying-the-target-task). For example:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: tests
      taskRef:
        name: integration-test
  finally:
    - name: cleanup-test
      taskRef:
        name: cleanup
```

### Specifying `Workspaces` in `finally` tasks

`finally` tasks can specify [workspaces](workspaces.md) which `PipelineTasks` might have utilized
e.g. a mount point for credentials held in Secrets. To support that requirement, you can specify one or more
`Workspaces` in the `workspaces` field for the `finally` tasks similar to `tasks`.

```yaml
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: shared-workspace
  tasks:
    - name: clone-app-source
      taskRef:
        name: clone-app-repo-to-workspace
      workspaces:
        - name: shared-workspace
          workspace: shared-workspace
  finally:
    - name: cleanup-workspace
      taskRef:
        name: cleanup-workspace
      workspaces:
        - name: shared-workspace
          workspace: shared-workspace
```

### Specifying `Parameters` in `finally` tasks

Similar to `tasks`, you can specify [`Parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters) in `finally` tasks:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: tests
      taskRef:
        name: integration-test
  finally:
    - name: report-results
      taskRef:
        name: report-results
      params:
        - name: url
          value: "someURL"
```

### Specifying `matrix` in `finally` tasks

> :seedling: **`Matrix` is an [beta](additional-configs.md#beta-features) feature.**
> The `enable-api-fields` feature flag can be set to `"beta"` to specify `Matrix` in a `PipelineTask`.

Similar to `tasks`, you can also provide [`Parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters) through `matrix`
in `finally` tasks:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: tests
      taskRef:
        name: integration-test
  finally:
    - name: report-results
      taskRef:
        name: report-results
      params:
        - name: url
          value: "someURL"
      matrix:
        params:
        - name: slack-channel
          value:
          - "foo"
          - "bar"
        include:
          - name: build-1
            params:
              - name: slack-channel
                value: "foo"
              - name: flags
                value: "-v"
```

For further information, read [`Matrix`](./matrix.md).

### Consuming `Task` execution results in `finally`

`finally` tasks can be configured to consume `Results` of `PipelineTask` from the `tasks` section:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: clone-app-repo
      taskRef:
        name: git-clone
  finally:
    - name: discover-git-commit
      params:
        - name: commit
          value: $(tasks.clone-app-repo.results.commit)
```
**Note:** The scheduling of such `finally` task does not change, it will still be executed in parallel with other
`finally` tasks after all non-`finally` tasks are done.

The controller resolves task results before executing the `finally` task `discover-git-commit`. If the task
`clone-app-repo` failed before initializing `commit` or skipped with [when expression](#guard-task-execution-using-when-expressions)
resulting in uninitialized task result `commit`, the `finally` Task `discover-git-commit` will be included in the list of
`skippedTasks` and continues executing rest of the `finally` tasks. The pipeline exits with `completion` instead of
`success` if a `finally` task is added to the list of `skippedTasks`.

### Consuming `Pipeline` result with `finally`

`finally` tasks can emit `Results` and these results emitted from the `finally` tasks can be configured in the
[Pipeline Results](#emitting-results-from-a-pipeline). References of `Results` from `finally` will follow the same naming conventions as referencing `Results` from `tasks`: ```$(finally.<finally-pipelinetask-name>.result.<result-name>)```.

```yaml
results:
  - name: comment-count-validate
    value: $(finally.check-count.results.comment-count-validate)
finally:
  - name: check-count
    taskRef:
      name: example-task-name
```

In this example, `pipelineResults` in `status` will show the name-value pair for the result `comment-count-validate` which is produced in the `Task` `example-task-name`.


### `PipelineRun` Status with `finally`

With `finally`, `PipelineRun` status is calculated based on `PipelineTasks` under `tasks` section and `finally` tasks.

Without `finally`:

| `PipelineTasks` under `tasks`                                                                           | `PipelineRun` status | Reason      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| all `PipelineTasks` successful                                                                          | `true`               | `Succeeded` |
| one or more `PipelineTasks` [skipped](#guard-task-execution-using-when-expressions) and rest successful | `true`               | `Completed` |
| single failure of `PipelineTask`                                                                        | `false`              | `failed`    |

With `finally`:

| `PipelineTasks` under `tasks`                                                                          | `finally` tasks                        | `PipelineRun` status | Reason      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| all `PipelineTask` successful                                                                          | all `finally` tasks successful         | `true`               | `Succeeded` |
| all `PipelineTask` successful                                                                          | one or more failure of `finally` tasks | `false`              | `Failed`    |
| one or more `PipelineTask` [skipped](#guard-task-execution-using-when-expressions) and rest successful | all `finally` tasks successful         | `true`               | `Completed` |
| one or more `PipelineTask` [skipped](#guard-task-execution-using-when-expressions) and rest successful | one or more failure of `finally` tasks | `false`              | `Failed`    |
| single failure of `PipelineTask`                                                                       | all `finally` tasks successful         | `false`              | `failed`    |
| single failure of `PipelineTask`                                                                       | one or more failure of `finally` tasks | `false`              | `failed`    |

Overall, `PipelineRun` state transitioning is explained below for respective scenarios:

* All `PipelineTask` and `finally` tasks are successful: `Started` -> `Running` -> `Succeeded`
* At least one `PipelineTask` skipped and rest successful:  `Started` -> `Running` -> `Completed`
* One `PipelineTask` failed / one or more `finally` tasks failed: `Started` -> `Running` -> `Failed`

Please refer to the [table](pipelineruns.md#monitoring-execution-status) under Monitoring Execution Status to learn about
what kind of events are triggered based on the `Pipelinerun` status.


### Using Execution `Status` of `pipelineTask`

A `pipeline` can check the status of a specific `pipelineTask` from the `tasks` section in `finally` through the task
parameters:

```yaml
finally:
  - name: finaltask
    params:
      - name: task1Status
        value: "$(tasks.task1.status)"
    taskSpec:
      params:
        - name: task1Status
      steps:
        - image: ubuntu
          name: print-task-status
          script: |
            if [ $(params.task1Status) == "Failed" ]
            then
              echo "Task1 has failed, continue processing the failure"
            fi
```

This kind of variable can have any one of the values from the following table:

| Status      | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Succeeded` | `taskRun` for the `pipelineTask` completed successfully                                          |
| `Failed`    | `taskRun` for the `pipelineTask` completed with a failure or cancelled by the user               |
| `None`      | the `pipelineTask` has been skipped or no execution information available for the `pipelineTask` |

For an end-to-end example, see [`status` in a `PipelineRun`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-task-execution-status.yaml).

### Using Aggregate Execution `Status` of All `Tasks`

A `pipeline` can check an aggregate status of all the `tasks` section in `finally` through the task parameters:

```yaml
finally:
  - name: finaltask
    params:
      - name: aggregateTasksStatus
        value: "$(tasks.status)"
    taskSpec:
      params:
        - name: aggregateTasksStatus
      steps:
        - image: ubuntu
          name: check-task-status
          script: |
            if [ $(params.aggregateTasksStatus) == "Failed" ]
            then
              echo "Looks like one or more tasks returned failure, continue processing the failure"
            fi
```

This kind of variable can have any one of the values from the following table:

| Status      | Description                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Succeeded` | all `tasks` have succeeded                                                                                                        |
| `Failed`    | one ore more `tasks` failed                                                                                                       |
| `Completed` | all `tasks` completed successfully including one or more skipped tasks                                                            |
| `None`      | no aggregate execution status available (i.e. none of the above), one or more `tasks` could be pending/running/cancelled/timedout |

For an end-to-end example, see [`$(tasks.status)` usage in a `Pipeline`](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-task-execution-status.yaml).

### Guard `finally` `Task` execution using `when` expressions

Similar to `Tasks`, `finally` `Tasks` can be guarded using [`when` expressions](#guard-task-execution-using-when-expressions)
that operate on static inputs or variables. Like in `Tasks`, `when` expressions in `finally` `Tasks` can operate on
`Parameters` and `Results`. Unlike in `Tasks`, `when` expressions in `finally` `tasks` can also operate on the [`Execution
Status`](#using-execution-status-of-pipelinetask) of `Tasks`.

#### `when` expressions using `Parameters` in `finally` `Tasks`

`when` expressions in `finally` `Tasks` can utilize `Parameters` as demonstrated using [`golang-build`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/golang-build/0.1)
and [`send-to-channel-slack`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/send-to-channel-slack/0.1) Catalog
`Tasks`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: pipelinerun-
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    params:
      - name: enable-notifications
        type: string
        description: a boolean indicating whether the notifications should be sent
    tasks:
      - name: golang-build
        taskRef:
          name: golang-build
      # […]
    finally:
      - name: notify-build-failure # executed only when build task fails and notifications are enabled
        when:
          - input: $(tasks.golang-build.status)
            operator: in
            values: ["Failed"]
          - input: $(params.enable-notifications)
            operator: in
            values: ["true"]
        taskRef:
          name: send-to-slack-channel
      # […]
  params:

#### `when` expressions using `Results` in `finally` 'Tasks`

`when` expressions in `finally` `tasks` can utilize `Results`, as demonstrated using [`git-clone`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/git-clone/0.2)
and [`github-add-comment`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/github-add-comment/0.2) Catalog `Tasks`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: pipelinerun-
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
      - name: git-clone
        taskRef:
          name: git-clone
      - name: go-build
      # […]
    finally:
      - name: notify-commit-sha # executed only when commit sha is not the expected sha
        when:
          - input: $(tasks.git-clone.results.commit)
            operator: notin
            values: [$(params.expected-sha)]
        taskRef:
          name: github-add-comment
      # […]
  params:
    - name: expected-sha
      value: 54dd3984affab47f3018852e61a1a6f9946ecfa
```

If the `when` expressions in a `finally` `task` use `Results` from a skipped or failed non-finally `Tasks`, then the
`finally` `task` would also be skipped and be included in the list of `Skipped Tasks` in the `Status`, [similarly to when using
`Results` in other parts of the `finally` `task`](#consuming-task-execution-results-in-finally).

#### `when` expressions using `Execution Status` of `PipelineTask` in `finally` `tasks`

`when` expressions in `finally` `tasks` can utilize [`Execution Status` of `PipelineTasks`](#using-execution-status-of-pipelinetask),
as demonstrated using [`golang-build`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/golang-build/0.1) and
[`send-to-channel-slack`](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/send-to-channel-slack/0.1) Catalog `Tasks`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: pipelinerun-
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
      - name: golang-build
        taskRef:
          name: golang-build
      # […]
    finally:
      - name: notify-build-failure # executed only when build task fails
        when:
          - input: $(tasks.golang-build.status)
            operator: in
            values: ["Failed"]
        taskRef:
          name: send-to-slack-channel
      # […]
```

For an end-to-end example, see [PipelineRun with `when` expressions](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-with-when-expressions.yaml).

#### `when` expressions using `Aggregate Execution Status` of `Tasks` in `finally` `tasks`

`when` expressions in `finally` `tasks` can utilize
[`Aggregate Execution Status` of `Tasks`](#using-aggregate-execution-status-of-all-tasks) as demonstrated:

```yaml
finally:
  - name: notify-any-failure # executed only when one or more tasks fail
    when:
      - input: $(tasks.status)
        operator: in
        values: ["Failed"]
    taskRef:
      name: notify-failure
```

For an end-to-end example, see [PipelineRun with `when` expressions](../examples/v1/pipelineruns/pipelinerun-with-when-expressions.yaml).

### Known Limitations

#### Cannot configure the `finally` task execution order

It's not possible to configure or modify the execution order of the `finally` tasks. Unlike `Tasks` in a `Pipeline`,
all `finally` tasks run simultaneously and start executing once all `PipelineTasks` under `tasks` have settled which means
no `runAfter` can be specified in `finally` tasks.

## Using Custom Tasks

Custom Tasks have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. Starting from `v0.43.0` to `v0.46.0`, Pipeline Controller is able to create either `v1alpha1` or `v1beta1` Custom Task gated by a feature flag `custom-task-version`, defaulting to `v1beta1`. You can set `custom-task-version` to `v1alpha1` or `v1beta1` to control which version to create.

Starting from `v0.47.0`, feature flag `custom-task-version` is removed and only `v1beta1` Custom Task will be supported. See the [migration doc](migrating-v1alpha1.Run-to-v1beta1.CustomRun.md) for details.

[Custom Tasks](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0002-custom-tasks.md)
can implement behavior that doesn't correspond directly to running a workload in a `Pod` on the cluster.
For example, a custom task might execute some operation outside of the cluster and wait for its execution to complete.

A `PipelineRun` starts a custom task by creating a [`CustomRun`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/customruns.md) instead of a `TaskRun`.
In order for a custom task to execute, there must be a custom task controller running on the cluster
that is responsible for watching and updating `CustomRun`s which reference their type.

### Specifying the target Custom Task

To specify the custom task type you want to execute, the `taskRef` field
must include the custom task's `apiVersion` and `kind` as shown below.
Using `apiVersion` will always create a `CustomRun`. If `apiVersion` is set, `kind` is required as well.

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
```

This creates a `Run/CustomRun` of a custom task of type `Example` in the `example.dev` API group with the version `v1alpha1`.

Validation error will be returned if `apiVersion` or `kind` is missing.

You can also specify the `name` of a custom task resource object previously defined in the cluster.

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
```

If the `taskRef` specifies a name, the custom task controller should look up the
`Example` resource with that name and use that object to configure the execution.

If the `taskRef` does not specify a name, the custom task controller might support
some default behavior for executing unnamed tasks.

### Specifying a Custom Task Spec in-line (or embedded)

**For `v1alpha1.Run`**
```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskSpec:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        spec:
          field1: value1
          field2: value2
```

**For `v1beta1.CustomRun`**
```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskSpec:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        customSpec:
          field1: value1
          field2: value2
```

If the custom task controller supports the in-line or embedded task spec, this will create a `Run/CustomRun` of a custom task of
type `Example` in the `example.dev` API group with the version `v1alpha1`.

If the `taskSpec` is not supported, the custom task controller should produce proper validation errors.

Please take a look at the
developer guide for custom controllers supporting `taskSpec`:
- [guidance for `Run`](runs.md#developer-guide-for-custom-controllers-supporting-spec)
- [guidance for `CustomRun`](customruns.md#developer-guide-for-custom-controllers-supporting-customspec)

`taskSpec` support for `pipelineRun` was designed and discussed in
[TEP-0061](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0061-allow-custom-task-to-be-embedded-in-pipeline.md)

### Specifying parameters

If a custom task supports [`parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters), you can use the
`params` field to specify their values:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
      params:
        - name: foo
          value: bah
```

## Context Variables

The `Parameters` in the `Params` field will accept
[context variables](variables.md) that will be substituted, including:

* `PipelineRun` name, namespace and uid
* `Pipeline` name
* `PipelineTask` retries

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
      params:
        - name: foo
          value: $(context.pipeline.name)
```

### Specifying matrix

> :seedling: **`Matrix` is an [alpha](additional-configs.md#alpha-features) feature.**
> The `enable-api-fields` feature flag must be set to `"alpha"` to specify `Matrix` in a `PipelineTask`.

If a custom task supports [`parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters), you can use the
`matrix` field to specify their values, if you want to fan:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
      params:
        - name: foo
          value: bah
      matrix:
        params:
        - name: bar
          value:
            - qux
            - thud
        include:
          - name: build-1
            params:
            - name: common-package
              value: path-to-common-pkg
```

For further information, read [`Matrix`](./matrix.md).

### Specifying workspaces

If the custom task supports it, you can provide [`Workspaces`](workspaces.md#using-workspaces-in-tasks) to share data with the custom task.

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
      workspaces:
        - name: my-workspace
```

Consult the documentation of the custom task that you are using to determine whether it supports workspaces and how to name them.

### Using `Results`

If the custom task produces results, you can reference them in a Pipeline using the normal syntax,
`$(tasks.<task-name>.results.<result-name>)`.

### Specifying `Timeout`

#### `v1alpha1.Run`
If the custom task supports it as [we recommended](runs.md#developer-guide-for-custom-controllers-supporting-timeout), you can provide `timeout` to specify the maximum running time of a `CustomRun` (including all retry attempts or other operations).

#### `v1beta1.CustomRun`
If the custom task supports it as [we recommended](customruns.md#developer-guide-for-custom-controllers-supporting-timeout), you can provide `timeout` to specify the maximum running time of one `CustomRun` execution.

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      timeout: 2s
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
```

Consult the documentation of the custom task that you are using to determine whether it supports `Timeout`.

### Specifying `Retries`
If the custom task supports it, you can provide `retries` to specify how many times you want to retry the custom task.

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: run-custom-task
      retries: 2
      taskRef:
        apiVersion: example.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: Example
        name: myexample
```

Consult the documentation of the custom task that you are using to determine whether it supports `Retries`.
