# Affinity Assistants

Affinity Assistant is a feature to coschedule `PipelineRun` `pods` to the same node
based on [kubernetes pod affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity) so that it possible for the taskruns to execute parallel while sharing volume.
Available Affinity Assistant Modes are **coschedule workspaces**, **coschedule pipelineruns**,
**isolate pipelinerun** and **disabled**.

> :seedling: **coschedule pipelineruns** and **isolate pipelinerun** modes are [**alpha features**](./additional-configs.md#alpha-features).
> **coschedule workspaces** is a **stable feature**

* **coschedule workspaces** - When a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is used as volume source for a `Workspace` in a `PipelineRun`,
all `TaskRun` pods within the `PipelineRun` that share the `Workspace` will be scheduled to the same Node. (**Note:** Only one pvc-backed workspace can be mounted to each TaskRun in this mode.)

* **coschedule pipelineruns** - All `TaskRun` pods within the `PipelineRun` will be scheduled to the same Node.

* **isolate pipelinerun** - All `TaskRun` pods within the `PipelineRun` will be scheduled to the same Node,
and only one PipelineRun is allowed to run on a node at a time.

* **disabled** - The Affinity Assistant is disabled. No pod coscheduling behavior.

This means that Affinity Assistant is incompatible with other affinity rules
configured for the `TaskRun` pods (i.e. other affinity rules specified in custom [PodTemplate](pipelineruns.md#specifying-a-pod-template) will be overwritten by Affinity Assistant).
If the `PipelineRun` has a custom [PodTemplate](pipelineruns.md#specifying-a-pod-template) configured, the `NodeSelector` and `Tolerations` fields will also be set on the Affinity Assistant pod. The Affinity Assistant
is deleted when the `PipelineRun` is completed.

The Affinity Assistant Modes are configured by the `coschedule` feature flag.
Previously, it was also controlled by the `disable-affinity-assistant` feature flag which was deprecated and removed after release `v0.68`.

The following chart summarizes the Affinity Assistant Modes with different combinations of the `disable-affinity-assistant` and `coschedule` feature flags during migration (when both feature flags are present) and after the migration (when only the `coschedule` flag is present).

**Note:** After release `v0.68`, the `disable-affinity-assistant` feature flag is removed and the Affinity Assistant Modes are only controlled by the `coschedule` feature flag.

**Note:** Affinity Assistant use [Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)
that require substantial amount of processing which can slow down scheduling in large clusters
significantly. We do not recommend using the affinity assistant in clusters larger than several hundred nodes

**Note:** Pod anti-affinity requires nodes to be consistently labelled, in other words every
node in the cluster must have an appropriate label matching `topologyKey`. If some or all nodes
are missing the specified `topologyKey` label, it can lead to unintended behavior.

**Note:** Any time during the execution of a `pipelineRun`, if the node with a placeholder Affinity Assistant pod and
the `taskRun` pods sharing a `workspace` is `cordoned` or disabled for scheduling anything new (`tainted`), the
`pipelineRun` controller deletes the placeholder pod. The `taskRun` pods on a `cordoned` node continues running
until completion. The deletion of a placeholder pod triggers creating a new placeholder pod on any available node
such that the rest of the `pipelineRun` can continue without any disruption until it finishes.
