## Overview

A `TaskRun` allows you to instantiate and execute a [`Task`](tasks.md) on-cluster. A `Task` specifies one or more
`Steps` that execute container images and each container image performs a specific piece of build work. A `TaskRun` executes the
`Steps` in the `Task` in the order they are specified until all `Steps` have executed successfully or a failure occurs.

## Configuring a `TaskRun`

A `TaskRun` definition supports the following fields:

- Required:
  - [`apiVersion`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the API version, for example
    `tekton.dev/v1beta1`.
  - [`kind`][kubernetes-overview] - Identifies this resource object as a `TaskRun` object.
  - [`metadata`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the metadata that uniquely identifies the
    `TaskRun`, such as a `name`.
  - [`spec`][kubernetes-overview] - Specifies the configuration for the `TaskRun`.
    - [`taskRef` or `taskSpec`](#specifying-the-target-task) - Specifies the `Tasks` that the
    `TaskRun` will execute.
- Optional:
  - [`serviceAccountName`](#specifying-serviceaccount-credentials) - Specifies a `ServiceAccount`
    object that provides custom credentials for executing the `TaskRun`.
  - [`params`](#specifying-parameters) - Specifies the desired execution parameters for the `Task`.
  - [`timeout`](#configuring-the-failure-timeout) - Specifies the timeout before the `TaskRun` fails.
  - [`podTemplate`](#specifying-a-pod-template) - Specifies a [`Pod` template](podtemplates.md) to use as
    the starting point for configuring the `Pods` for the `Task`.
  - [`workspaces`](#specifying-workspaces) - Specifies the physical volumes to use for the
    [`Workspaces`](workspaces.md#using-workspaces-in-tasks) declared by a `Task`.
  - [`debug`](#debugging-a-taskrun)- Specifies any breakpoints and debugging configuration for the `Task` execution.
  - [`stepOverrides`](#overriding-task-steps-and-sidecars) - Specifies configuration to use to override the `Task`'s `Step`s.
  - [`sidecarOverrides`](#overriding-task-steps-and-sidecars) - Specifies configuration to use to override the `Task`'s `Sidecar`s.

### Specifying the target `Task`

To specify the `Task` you want to execute in your `TaskRun`, use the `taskRef` field as shown below:

```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: read-task
```

You can also embed the desired `Task` definition directly in the `TaskRun` using the `taskSpec` field:

```yaml
spec:
  taskSpec:
    workspaces:
    - name: source
    steps:
      - name: build-and-push
        image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.17.1
        # specifying DOCKER_CONFIG is required to allow kaniko to detect docker credential
        workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
        env:
          - name: "DOCKER_CONFIG"
            value: "/tekton/home/.docker/"
        command:
          - /kaniko/executor
        args:
          - --destination=gcr.io/my-project/gohelloworld
```

#### Tekton Bundles

A `Tekton Bundle` is an OCI artifact that contains Tekton resources like `Tasks` which can be referenced within a `taskRef`.

You can reference a `Tekton bundle` in a `TaskRef` in both `v1` and `v1beta1` using [remote resolution](./bundle-resolver.md#pipeline-resolution). The example syntax shown below for `v1` uses remote resolution and requires enabling [beta features](./additional-configs.md#beta-features).

```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```

You may also specify a `tag` as you would with a Docker image which will give you a repeatable reference to a `Task`.

```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog:v1.0.1
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```

You may also specify a fixed digest instead of a tag which ensures the referenced task is constant.

```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: bundles
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: docker.io/myrepo/mycatalog@sha256:abc123
    - name: name
      value: echo-task
    - name: kind
      value: Task
```

A working example can be found [here](../examples/v1beta1/taskruns/no-ci/tekton-bundles.yaml).

Any of the above options will fetch the image using the `ImagePullSecrets` attached to the
`ServiceAccount` specified in the `TaskRun`. See the [Service Account](#service-account)
section for details on how to configure a `ServiceAccount` on a `TaskRun`. The `TaskRun`
will then run that `Task` without registering it in the cluster allowing multiple versions
of the same named `Task` to be run at once.

`Tekton Bundles` may be constructed with any toolsets that produces valid OCI image artifacts so long as
the artifact adheres to the [contract](tekton-bundle-contracts.md). Additionally, you may also use the `tkn`
cli *(coming soon)*.

#### Remote Tasks

**([beta feature](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/install.md#beta-features))**

A `taskRef` field may specify a Task in a remote location such as git.
Support for specific types of remote will depend on the Resolvers your
cluster's operator has installed. For more information including a tutorial, please check [resolution docs](resolution.md). The below example demonstrates referencing a Task in git:

```yaml
spec:
  taskRef:
    resolver: git
    params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog.git
    - name: revision
      value: abc123
    - name: pathInRepo
      value: /task/golang-build/0.3/golang-build.yaml
```

### Specifying `Parameters`

If a `Task` has [`parameters`](tasks.md#specifying-parameters), you can use the `params` field to specify their values:

```yaml
spec:
  params:
    - name: flags
      value: -someflag
```

**Note:** If a parameter does not have an implicit default value, you must explicitly set its value.

#### Propagated Parameters

When using an inlined `taskSpec`, parameters from the parent `TaskRun` will be
available to the `Task` without needing to be explicitly defined.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: hello-
spec:
  params:
    - name: message
      value: "hello world!"
  taskSpec:
    # There are no explicit params defined here.
    # They are derived from the TaskRun params above.
    steps:
    - name: default
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        echo $(params.message)
```

On executing the task run, the parameters will be interpolated during resolution.
The specifications are not mutated before storage and so it remains the same.
The status is updated.

```yaml
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: hello-dlqm9
  ...
spec:
  params:
  - name: message
    value: hello world!
  serviceAccountName: default
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    - image: ubuntu
      name: default
      script: |
        echo $(params.message)
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-05-20T15:24:41Z"
    message: All Steps have completed executing
    reason: Succeeded
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
  ...
  steps:
  - container: step-default
    ...
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    - image: ubuntu
      name: default
      script: |
        echo "hello world!"
```

#### Propagated Object Parameters
When using an inlined `taskSpec`, object parameters from the parent `TaskRun` will be
available to the `Task` without needing to be explicitly defined.


**Note:** If an object parameter is being defined explicitly then you must define the spec of the object in `Properties`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: object-param-result-
spec:
  params:
  - name: gitrepo
    value:
      commit: sha123
      url: xyz.com
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    - name: echo-object-params
      image: bash
      args:
      - echo
      - --url=$(params.gitrepo.url)
      - --commit=$(params.gitrepo.commit)
```

On executing the task run, the object parameters will be interpolated during resolution.
The specifications are not mutated before storage and so it remains the same.
The status is updated.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: object-param-result-vlnmb
  ...
spec:
  params:
  - name: gitrepo
    value:
      commit: sha123
      url: xyz.com
  serviceAccountName: default
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    - args:
      - echo
      - --url=$(params.gitrepo.url)
      - --commit=$(params.gitrepo.commit)
      image: bash
      name: echo-object-params
status:
  completionTime: "2022-09-08T17:09:37Z"
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-09-08T17:09:37Z"
    message: All Steps have completed executing
    reason: Succeeded
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
    ...
  steps:
  - container: step-echo-object-params
    ...
  taskSpec:
    steps:
    - args:
      - echo
      - --url=xyz.com
      - --commit=sha123
      image: bash
      name: echo-object-params
```

#### Extra Parameters

**([alpha only](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/additional-configs.md#alpha-features))**

You can pass in extra `Parameters` if needed depending on your use cases. An example use
case is when your CI system autogenerates `TaskRuns` and it has `Parameters` it wants to
provide to all `TaskRuns`. Because you can pass in extra `Parameters`, you don't have to
go through the complexity of checking each `Task` and providing only the required params.

#### Parameter Enums

> :seedling: **`enum` is an [alpha](additional-configs.md#alpha-features) feature.** The `enable-param-enum` feature flag must be set to `"true"` to enable this feature.

If a `Parameter` is guarded by `Enum` in the `Task`, you can only provide `Parameter` values in the `TaskRun` that are predefined in the `Param.Enum` in the `Task`. The `TaskRun` will fail with reason `InvalidParamValue` otherwise.

You can also specify `Enum` for [`TaskRun` with an embedded `Task`](#example-taskrun-with-an-embedded-task). The same param validation will be executed in this scenario.

See more details in [Param.Enum](./tasks.md#param-enum).

### Specifying `Resource` limits

Each Step in a Task can specify its resource requirements. See
[Defining `Steps`](tasks.md#defining-steps). Resource requirements defined in Steps and Sidecars
may be overridden by a TaskRun's StepSpecs and SidecarSpecs.

### Specifying Task-level `ComputeResources`

**([beta only](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/additional-configs.md#beta-features))**

Task-level compute resources can be configured in `TaskRun.ComputeResources`, or `PipelineRun.TaskRunSpecs.ComputeResources`.

e.g.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: task
spec:
  steps:
    - name: foo
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: taskrun
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: task
  computeResources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1
    limits:
      cpu: 2
```

Further details and examples could be found in [Compute Resources in Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/compute-resources.md).

### Specifying a `Pod` template

You can specify a [`Pod` template](podtemplates.md) configuration that will serve as the configuration starting
point for the `Pod` in which the container images specified in your `Task` will execute. This allows you to
customize the `Pod` configuration specifically for that `TaskRun`.

In the following example, the `Task` specifies a `volumeMount` (`my-cache`) object, also provided by the `TaskRun`,
using a `PersistentVolumeClaim` volume. A specific scheduler is also configured in the  `SchedulerName` field.
The `Pod` executes with regular (non-root) user permissions.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: mytask
  namespace: default
spec:
  steps:
    - name: writesomething
      image: ubuntu
      command: ["bash", "-c"]
      args: ["echo 'foo' > /my-cache/bar"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: my-cache
          mountPath: /my-cache
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: mytaskrun
  namespace: default
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: mytask
  podTemplate:
    schedulerName: volcano
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1001
    volumes:
      - name: my-cache
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: my-volume-claim
```

### Specifying `Workspaces`

If a `Task` specifies one or more `Workspaces`, you must map those `Workspaces` to
the corresponding physical volumes in your `TaskRun` definition. For example, you
can map a `PersistentVolumeClaim` volume to a `Workspace` as follows:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - name: myworkspace # must match workspace name in the Task
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mypvc # this PVC must already exist
    subPath: my-subdir
```

For more information, see the following topics:
- For information on mapping `Workspaces` to `Volumes`, see [Using `Workspace` variables in `TaskRuns`](workspaces.md#using-workspace-variables-in-taskruns).
- For a list of supported `Volume` types, see [Specifying `VolumeSources` in `Workspaces`](workspaces.md#specifying-volumesources-in-workspaces).
- For an end-to-end example, see [`Workspaces` in a `TaskRun`](../examples/v1/taskruns/workspace.yaml).

#### Propagated Workspaces

When using an embedded spec, workspaces from the parent `TaskRun` will be
propagated to any inlined specs without needing to be explicitly defined. This
allows authors to simplify specs by automatically propagating top-level
workspaces down to other inlined resources.
**Workspace substutions will only be made for `commands`, `args` and `script` fields of `steps`, `stepTemplates`, and `sidecars`.**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: propagating-workspaces-
spec:
  taskSpec:
    steps:
      - name: simple-step
        image: ubuntu
        command:
          - echo
        args:
          - $(workspaces.tr-workspace.path)
  workspaces:
  - emptyDir: {}
    name: tr-workspace
```

Upon execution, the workspaces will be interpolated during resolution through to the `taskSpec`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: propagating-workspaces-ndxnc
  ...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
  taskSpec:
    steps:
      ...
    workspaces:
    - name: tr-workspace

```

##### Propagating Workspaces to Referenced Tasks

Workspaces can only be propagated to `embedded` task specs, not `referenced` Tasks.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: workspace-propagation
spec:
  steps:
    - name: simple-step
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - $(workspaces.tr-workspace.path)
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: propagating-workspaces-
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: workspace-propagation
  workspaces:
  - emptyDir: {}
    name: tr-workspace
```

Upon execution, the above `TaskRun` will fail because the `Task` is referenced and workspace is not propagated. It must be explicitly defined in the `spec` of the defined `Task`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  taskRef:
    kind: Task
    name: workspace-propagation
  workspaces:
  - emptyDir: {}
    name: tr-workspace
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-09-13T15:12:35Z"
    message: workspace binding "tr-workspace" does not match any declared workspace
    reason: TaskRunValidationFailed
    status: "False"
    type: Succeeded
  ...
```

### Specifying `Sidecars`

A `Sidecar` is a container that runs alongside the containers specified
in the `Steps` of a task to provide auxiliary support to the execution of
those `Steps`. For example, a `Sidecar` can run a logging daemon, a service
that updates files on a shared volume, or a network proxy.

Tekton supports the injection of `Sidecars` into a `Pod` belonging to
a `TaskRun` with the condition that each `Sidecar` running inside the
`Pod` are terminated as soon as all `Steps` in the `Task` complete execution.
This might result in the `Pod` including each affected `Sidecar` with a
retry count of 1 and a different container image than expected.

We are aware of the following issues affecting Tekton's implementation of `Sidecars`:

- The configured `nop` image **must not** provide the command that the
`Sidecar` is expected to run, otherwise it will not exit, resulting in the `Sidecar`
running forever and the Task eventually timing out. For more information, see the
[associated issue](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1347).

- The `kubectl get pods` command returns the status of the `Pod` as "Completed" if a
`Sidecar` exits successfully and as "Error" if a `Sidecar` exits with an error,
disregarding the exit codes of the container images that actually executed the `Steps`
inside the `Pod`. Only the above command is affected. The `Pod's` description correctly
denotes a "Failed" status and the container statuses correctly denote their exit codes
and reasons.

### Configuring Task Steps and Sidecars in a TaskRun

**([beta only](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/additional-configs.md#beta-features))**

A TaskRun can specify `StepSpecs` or `SidecarSpecs` to configure Step or Sidecar
specified in a Task. Only named Steps and Sidecars may be configured.

For example, given the following Task definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: image-build-task
spec:
  steps:
    - name: build
      image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
  sidecars:
    - name: logging
      image: my-logging-image
```

An example TaskRun definition could look like:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "v1" %}}
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: image-build-taskrun
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: image-build-task
  stepSpecs:
    - name: build
      computeResources:
        requests:
          memory: 1Gi
  sidecarSpecs:
    - name: logging
      computeResources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "v1beta1" %}}
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: image-build-taskrun
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: image-build-task
  stepOverrides:
    - name: build
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 1Gi
  sidecarOverrides:
    - name: logging
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

`StepSpecs` and `SidecarSpecs` must include the `name` field and may include `resources`.
No other fields can be overridden.
If the overridden `Task` uses a [`StepTemplate`](./tasks.md#specifying-a-step-template), configuration on
`Step` will take precedence over configuration in `StepTemplate`, and configuration in `StepSpec` will
take precedence over both.

When merging resource requirements, different resource types are considered independently.
For example, if a `Step` configures both CPU and memory, and a `StepSpec` configures only memory,
the CPU values from the `Step` will be preserved. Requests and limits are also considered independently.
For example, if a `Step` configures a memory request and limit, and a `StepSpec` configures only a
memory request, the memory limit from the `Step` will be preserved.

### Specifying `LimitRange` values

In order to only consume the bare minimum amount of resources needed to execute one `Step` at a
time from the invoked `Task`, Tekton will request the compute values for CPU, memory, and ephemeral
storage for each `Step` based on the [`LimitRange`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)
object(s), if present. Any `Request` or `Limit` specified by the user (on `Task` for example) will be left unchanged.

For more information, see the [`LimitRange` support in Pipeline](./compute-resources.md#limitrange-support).

### Specifying `Retries`
You can use the `retries` field to set how many times you want to retry on a failed TaskRun.
All TaskRun failures are retriable except for `Cancellation`.

For a retriable `TaskRun`, when an error occurs:
- The error status is archived in `status.RetriesStatus`
- The `Succeeded` condition in `status` is updated:
```
Type: Succeeded
Status: Unknown
Reason: ToBeRetried
```
- `status.StartTime`, `status.PodName` and `status.Results` are unset to trigger another retry attempt.

### Configuring the failure timeout

You can use the `timeout` field to set the `TaskRun's` desired timeout value for **each retry attempt**. If you do
not specify this value, the global default timeout value applies (the same, to `each retry attempt`). If you set the timeout to 0,
the `TaskRun` will have no timeout and will run until it completes successfully or fails from an error.

The `timeout` value is a `duration` conforming to Go's
[`ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) format. For example, valid
values are `1h30m`, `1h`, `1m`, `60s`, and `0`.

If a `TaskRun` runs longer than its timeout value, the pod associated with the `TaskRun` will be deleted. This
means that the logs of the `TaskRun` are not preserved. The deletion of the `TaskRun` pod is necessary in order to
stop `TaskRun` step containers from running.

The global default timeout is set to 60 minutes when you first install Tekton. You can set
a different global default timeout value using the `default-timeout-minutes` field in
[`config/config-defaults.yaml`](./../config/config-defaults.yaml). If you set the global timeout to 0,
all `TaskRuns` that do not have a timeout set will have no timeout and will run until it completes successfully
or fails from an error.

> :note: An internal detail of the `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` reconcilers in the Tekton controller is that it will requeue a `PipelineRun` or `TaskRun` for re-evaluation, versus waiting for the next update, under certain conditions.  The wait time for that re-queueing is the elapsed time subtracted from the timeout; however, if the timeout is set to '0', that calculation produces a negative number, and the new reconciliation event will fire immediately, which can impact overall performance, which is counter to the intent of wait time calculation.  So instead, the reconcilers will use the configured global timeout as the wait time when the associated timeout has been set to '0'.

### Specifying `ServiceAccount` credentials

You can execute the `Task` in your `TaskRun` with a specific set of credentials by
specifying a `ServiceAccount` object name in the `serviceAccountName` field in your `TaskRun`
definition. If you do not explicitly specify this, the `TaskRun` executes with the credentials
specified in the `configmap-defaults` `ConfigMap`. If this default is not specified, `TaskRuns`
will execute with the [`default` service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server)
set for the target [`namespace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

For more information, see [`ServiceAccount`](auth.md).
## `TaskRun` status
The `status` field defines the observed state of `TaskRun`
### The `status` field
- Required:
  - `status` - The most relevant information about the TaskRun's state. This field includes:
  <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
    - `status.conditions`, which contains the latest observations of the `TaskRun`'s state. [See here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties) for information on typical status properties.
  - `podName` - Name of the pod containing the containers responsible for executing this `task`'s `step`s.
  - `startTime` - The time at which the `TaskRun` began executing, conforms to [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.
  - `completionTime` - The time at which the `TaskRun` finished executing, conforms to [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.
  - [`taskSpec`](tasks.md#configuring-a-task) - `TaskSpec` defines the desired state of the `Task` executed via the `TaskRun`.

- Optional:
  - `results` - List of results written out by the `task`'s containers.

  - `provenance` - Provenance contains metadata about resources used in the `TaskRun` such as the source from where a remote `task` definition was fetched. It carries minimum amount of metadata in `TaskRun` `status` so that `Tekton Chains` can utilize it for provenance, its two subfields are:
    - `refSource`: the source from where a remote `Task` definition was fetched.
    - `featureFlags`: Identifies the feature flags used during the `TaskRun`.
  - `steps` - Contains the `state` of each `step` container.
    - `steps[].terminationReason` - When the step is terminated, it stores the step's final state.
  - `retriesStatus` - Contains the history of `TaskRun`'s `status` in case of a retry in order to keep record of failures. No `status` stored within `retriesStatus` will have any `date` within as it is redundant.

  - [`sidecars`](tasks.md#using-a-sidecar-in-a-task) - This field is a list. The list has one entry per `sidecar` in the manifest. Each entry represents the imageid of the corresponding sidecar.
  - `spanContext` - Contains tracing span context fields.



## Monitoring execution status

As your `TaskRun` executes, its `status` field accumulates information on the execution of each `Step`
as well as the `TaskRun` as a whole. This information includes start and stop times, exit codes, the
fully-qualified name of the container image, and the corresponding digest.

**Note:** If any `Pods` have been [`OOMKilled`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/)
by Kubernetes, the `TaskRun` is marked as failed even if its exit code is 0.

The following example shows the `status` field of a `TaskRun` that has executed successfully:

```yaml
completionTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:57Z"
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:57Z"
    message: All Steps have completed executing
    reason: Succeeded
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
podName: status-taskrun-pod
startTime: "2019-08-12T18:22:51Z"
steps:
  - container: step-hello
    imageID: docker-pullable://busybox@sha256:895ab622e92e18d6b461d671081757af7dbaa3b00e3e28e12505af7817f73649
    name: hello
    terminationReason: Completed
    terminated:
      containerID: docker://d5a54f5bbb8e7a6fd3bc7761b78410403244cf4c9c5822087fb0209bf59e3621
      exitCode: 0
      finishedAt: "2019-08-12T18:22:56Z"
      reason: Completed
      startedAt: "2019-08-12T18:22:54Z"
  ```

The following tables shows how to read the overall status of a `TaskRun`:

`status` | `reason`               | `message`                                                         | `completionTime` is set |                                                                                       Description

When a `TaskRun` changes status, [events](events.md#taskruns) are triggered accordingly.

The name of the `Pod` owned by a `TaskRun`  is univocally associated to the owning resource.
If a `TaskRun` resource is deleted and created with the same name, the child `Pod` will be created with the same name
as before. The base format of the name is `<taskrun-name>-pod`. The name may vary according to the logic of
[`kmeta.ChildName`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/knative/pkg/kmeta#ChildName). In case of retries of a `TaskRun`
triggered by the `PipelineRun` controller, the base format of the name is `<taskrun-name>-pod-retry<N>` starting from
the first retry.

Some examples:

| `TaskRun` Name                                                             | `Pod` Name                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| task-run                                                                   | task-run-pod                                                    |
| task-run-0123456789-0123456789-0123456789-0123456789-0123456789-0123456789 | task-run-0123456789-01234560d38957287bb0283c59440df14069f59-pod |


### Monitoring `Steps`

If multiple `Steps` are defined in the `Task` invoked by the `TaskRun`, you can monitor their execution
status in the `status.steps` field using the following command, where `<name>` is the name of the target
`TaskRun`:

```bash
kubectl get taskrun <name> -o yaml
```

The exact Task Spec used to instantiate the TaskRun is also included in the Status for full auditability.

### Steps

The corresponding statuses appear in the `status.steps` list in the order in which the `Steps` have been
specified in the `Task` definition.

### Monitoring `Results`

If one or more `results` fields have been specified in the invoked `Task`, the `TaskRun's` execution
status will include a `Task Results` section, in which the `Results` appear verbatim, including original
line returns and whitespace. For example:

```yaml
Status:
  # […]
  Steps:
  # […]
  Task Results:
    Name:   current-date-human-readable
    Value:  Thu Jan 23 16:29:06 UTC 2020

    Name:   current-date-unix-timestamp
    Value:  1579796946

```

## Cancelling a `TaskRun`

To cancel a `TaskRun` that's currently executing, update its status to mark it as cancelled.

When you cancel a TaskRun, the running pod associated with that `TaskRun` is deleted. This
means that the logs of the `TaskRun` are not preserved. The deletion of the `TaskRun` pod is necessary
in order to stop `TaskRun` step containers from running.

**Note: if `keep-pod-on-cancel` is set to
`"true"` in the `feature-flags`,  the pod associated with that `TaskRun` will not be deleted**

Example of cancelling a `TaskRun`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: go-example-git
spec:
  # […]
  status: "TaskRunCancelled"
```


## Debugging a `TaskRun`

### Breakpoint on Failure

TaskRuns can be halted on failure for troubleshooting by providing the following spec patch as seen below.

```yaml
spec:
  debug:
    breakpoints:
      onFailure: "enabled"
```

Upon failure of a step, the TaskRun Pod execution is halted. If this TaskRun Pod continues to run without any lifecycle
change done by the user (running the debug-continue or debug-fail-continue script) the TaskRun would be subject to
[TaskRunTimeout](#configuring-the-failure-timeout).
During this time, the user/client can get remote shell access to the step container with a command such as the following.

```bash
kubectl exec -it print-date-d7tj5-pod -c step-print-date-human-readable sh
```

### Debug Environment

After the user/client has access to the container environment, they can scour for any missing parts because of which
their step might have failed.

To control the lifecycle of the step to mark it as a success or a failure or close the breakpoint, there are scripts
provided in the `/tekton/debug/scripts` directory in the container. The following are the scripts and the tasks they
perform :-

`debug-continue`: Mark the step as a success and exit the breakpoint.

`debug-fail-continue`: Mark the step as a failure and exit the breakpoint.

*More information on the inner workings of debug can be found in the [Debug documentation](debug.md)*

## Code examples

To better understand `TaskRuns`, study the following code examples:

- [Example `TaskRun` with a referenced `Task`](#example-taskrun-with-a-referenced-task)
- [Example `TaskRun` with an embedded `Task`](#example-taskrun-with-an-embedded-task)
- [Example of reusing a `Task`](#example-of-reusing-a-task)
- [Example of Using custom `ServiceAccount` credentials](#example-of-using-custom-serviceaccount-credentials)
- [Example of Running Step Containers as a Non Root User](#example-of-running-step-containers-as-a-non-root-user)

### Example `TaskRun` with a referenced `Task`

In this example, a `TaskRun` named `read-repo-run` invokes and executes an existing
`Task` named `read-task`. This `Task` reads the repository from the
"input" `workspace`.

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: read-task
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: input
  steps:
    - name: readme
      image: ubuntu
      script: cat $(workspaces.input.path)/README.md
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: read-repo-run
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: read-task
  workspaces:
  - name: input
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mypvc
    subPath: my-subdir
```

### Example `TaskRun` with an embedded `Task`

In this example, a `TaskRun` named `build-push-task-run-2` directly executes
a `Task` from its definition embedded in the `TaskRun's` `taskSpec` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-push-task-run-2
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc
  taskSpec:
    workspaces:
    - name: source
    steps:
      - name: build-and-push
        image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.17.1
        workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
        # specifying DOCKER_CONFIG is required to allow kaniko to detect docker credential
        env:
          - name: "DOCKER_CONFIG"
            value: "/tekton/home/.docker/"
        command:
          - /kaniko/executor
        args:
          - --destination=gcr.io/my-project/gohelloworld
```

### Example of Using custom `ServiceAccount` credentials

The example below illustrates how to specify a `ServiceAccount` to access a private `git` repository:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: test-task-with-serviceaccount-git-ssh
spec:
  serviceAccountName: test-task-robot-git-ssh
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: repo-pvc
  - name: ssh-creds
    secret:
      secretName: test-git-ssh
  params:
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline.git
  taskRef:
    name: git-clone
```

In the above code snippet, `serviceAccountName: test-build-robot-git-ssh` references the following
`ServiceAccount`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: test-task-robot-git-ssh
secrets:
  - name: test-git-ssh
```

And `secretName: test-git-ssh` references the following `Secret`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-git-ssh
  annotations:
    tekton.dev/git-0: github.com
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
  # Generated by:
  # cat id_rsa | base64 -w 0
  ssh-privatekey: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVk.....[example]
  # Generated by:
  # ssh-keyscan github.com | base64 -w 0
  known_hosts: Z2l0aHViLmNvbSBzc2g.....[example]
```

### Example of Running Step Containers as a Non Root User

All steps that do not require to be run as a root user should make use of TaskRun features to
designate the container for a step runs as a user without root permissions. As a best practice,
running containers as non root should be built into the container image to avoid any possibility
of the container being run as root. However, as a further measure of enforcing this practice,
TaskRun pod templates can be used to specify how containers should be run within a TaskRun pod.

An example of using a TaskRun pod template is shown below to specify that containers running via this
TaskRun's pod should run as non root and run as user 1001 if the container itself does not specify what
user to run as:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1 # or tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  generateName: show-non-root-steps-run-
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: show-non-root-steps
  podTemplate:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1001
```

If a Task step specifies that it is to run as a different user than what is specified in the pod template,
the step's `securityContext` will be applied instead of what is specified at the pod level. An example of
this is available as a [TaskRun example](../examples/v1/taskruns/run-steps-as-non-root.yaml).

More information about Pod and Container Security Contexts can be found via the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).
