# Tekton Pipelines

Tekton Pipelines is a Kubernetes extension that installs and runs on your Kubernetes cluster.
It defines a set of Kubernetes [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) that act as building blocks from which you can assemble CI/CD pipelines. Once installed,
Tekton Pipelines becomes available via the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) and via API calls, just
like pods and other resources. Tekton is open-source and part of the [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/),
a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/) project.
