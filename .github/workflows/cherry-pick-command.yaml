# Cherry Pick Command Workflow
#
# This workflow is triggered by the /cherry-pick slash command from the slash.yml workflow.
# It automatically cherry-picks merged PRs to the specified target branches.
#
# Usage: Comment `/cherry-pick <target-branch> [<target-branch> ...]` on a merged pull request
# Example: `/cherry-pick release-v0.47.x`
# Example: `/cherry-pick release-v0.47.x release-v1.3.x`
#
# Security Notes:
# - Only users with "write" permission can trigger this command (enforced in slash.yml)
# - Works safely with PRs from forks because it only cherry-picks already-merged commits
# - Uses CHATOPS_TOKEN to create PRs and push to branches
# - The action creates a new branch from the target branch, not from the fork
