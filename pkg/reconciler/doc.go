// Package reconciler defines implementations of the Reconciler interface
// defined at github.com/knative/pkg/controller.Reconciler.  These implement
// the basic workhorse functionality of controllers, while leaving the
// shared controller implementation to manage things like the workqueue.
//
// Despite defining a Reconciler, each of the packages here are expected to
// expose a controller constructor like:
//    func NewController(...) *controller.Impl { ... }
// These constructors will:
// 1. Construct the Reconciler,
// 2. Construct a controller.Impl with that Reconciler,
// 3. Wire the assorted informers this Reconciler watches to call appropriate
//   enqueue methods on the controller.
