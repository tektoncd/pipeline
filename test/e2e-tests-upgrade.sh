# This script calls out to scripts in tektoncd/plumbing to setup a cluster
# and deploy Tekton Pipelines to it for running upgrading tests. There are
# two scenarios we need to cover in this script:

# Scenario 1: install the previous release, upgrade to the current release, and
# validate whether the Tekton pipeline works.

# Scenario 2: install the previous release, create the pipelines and tasks, upgrade
# to the current release, and validate whether the Tekton pipeline works.
